[Course_Description]
COVID-19 has drastically altered the way we move through familiar spaces. As more people start returning to work and school, facilities management teams must grapple with a number of complicated decisions. In this course, instructor Shaun Bryant prepares you to face those challenges head-on, explaining how to change the way people enter buildings, proper placement and distribution of hygiene stations, directional flow, and the creation of Neutral Zones (NZs). Shaun shows you how to change the layout of workplaces and classrooms to allow for social distancing. He also points out the impact of working from home, seating in public spaces, and other alternative methods of working.
