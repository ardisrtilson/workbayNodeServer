[Course_Description]
Learn how to play bluegrass guitarâ€”one of the most rewarding and technically demanding ways to play guitar. In part 3 of the Bluegrass Guitar Lessons series, Grammy-winning flatpicker Bryan Sutton concentrates on big-picture techniques that will help you develop your own personal sound. Learn intermediate techniques for fretting without tension and embellishing your sound with hammer-ons and pull-offs. Find out how to move beyond basic rhythms into more complex bass strum patterns, phrasing, and scale walking. Open up the fretboard with some exciting new scales and chord shapes. Bryan shows how to apply what you've learned to intermediate versions of popular bluegrass tunes, such as Turkey in the Straw and Soldier's Joy. Watch at your own pace; start and stop where and when you need. Each lesson helps you add a challenging new dimension to your sound, and improve your overall musicality.
