[Course_Description]
The Blackmagic Cinema Cameras are some of the hottest cameras on the market. The ability to shoot both raw video and high-quality production codecs makes these cameras ready for the most demanding jobs. This course reviews the entire workflow for using the Blackmagic Pocket, Micro, and Studio Cinema Camerasâ€”from preproduction to post. Learn how to choose the best Blackmagic camera for your shoot, power your camera and extend its battery life, and attach and swap lens. Plus, learn how to prep SD cards, CFAST cards, and SSDs to record; navigate the Blackmagic menu system; and choose the right settings for common production scenarios. Instructor Rich Harrington also shows how to capture high-quality audio, monitor recording, transfer footage off the camera, and keep your camera up to date.
