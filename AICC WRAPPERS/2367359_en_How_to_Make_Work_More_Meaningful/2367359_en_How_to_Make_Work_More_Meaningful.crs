[Course_Description]
There’s an emptiness that many feel about their work. They are disengaged because they feel that they're not doing what they are supposed to be doing with their life. In this course, instructor Dave Crenshaw helps professionals go beyond “getting stuff done” by adding the element of personal motivation to seemingly mundane workday activities. He explains that performance and outcomes improve when you are more personally connected to the work you do. To accomplish this, Dave explains how to define your personal values and make career and strategic decisions in relation to those values. He shares strategies for creating your personal vision and connecting it to what you do at work. Plus, he provides tips for identifying and celebrating your victories. This course was created by Dave Crenshaw and Invaluable Inc. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
