[Course_Description]
Learn professional techniques for producing and mixing electronic music in Ableton Live. Producer Nate Mars starts with the basics of the Ableton interface and different approaches to making electronic music—some of which incorporate Ableton Push 2, the exciting new pad-based MIDI controller. He explains the important Ableton fundamentals for working with clips, warping, and effects. Next, Nate demonstrates various techniques for programming the foundation of a track—the drums—in a variety of EDM genres. He then moves into creating basslines via analog synthesis and creating lead synth sounds with Ableton Live's built-in Operator synth. He also goes into how to create and use samples and MIDI effects, and use Push 2 for production and mixing. He pulls it all together in the final few chapters, which demonstrate ways to arrange tracks, use creative effects, mix tracks together, and use automation to finalize the mix.
