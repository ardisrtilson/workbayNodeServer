[Course_Description]
This second installment in On Camera, a series designed to help anyone create a positive impression on-screen, concentrates on enhancing your appearance with makeup. Author Rick Allen Lippert shows how to apply the right amount of makeup for today's high-def cameras, which tend to capture much more visual information. The course is divided into six sections: what to purchase, basic makeup for men, basic makeup for women, makeup for darker skin, airbrushing, and body makeup for covering tattoos and blemishes.
