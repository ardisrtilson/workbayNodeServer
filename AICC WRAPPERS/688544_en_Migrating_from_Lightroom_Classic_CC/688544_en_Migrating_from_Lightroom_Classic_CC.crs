[Course_Description]
With the release of Lightroom CC, existing Lightroom customers are unsure what to do with their images. Do they stay with Lightroom Classic CC, upgrade to the new mobile-focused Lightroom CC, or try an alternative? This course covers the basics of what it takes to move your images to Lightroom CC or to a number of alternative software packages, including On1 Photo RAW, Capture One, ACDSee, and Skylum Luminar. Instructor Rich Harrington covers the costs, pros, and cons of each different option, and shows how to prepare, back up, and move your catalogâ€”without losing any precious metadata or photographs.
