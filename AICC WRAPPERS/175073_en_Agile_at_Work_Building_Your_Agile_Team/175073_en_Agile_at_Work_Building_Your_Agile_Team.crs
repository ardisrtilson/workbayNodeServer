[Course_Description]
Agile is becoming the preferred project management approach for fast-moving projects. At the heart of any agile project lies an agile team. In this course, the first in the Agile at Work series, expert Doug Rose uses a sample project to show how to build your agile team. A team with an agile mindset is self-organized, collaborative, and accountable. He also outlines the common pitfalls inherent in the implementation: new teams need to watch for confusing their roles and understand the challenges with managing self-organized groups.
