[Course_Description]
More and more photographers are discovering—or rediscovering—the pleasures of analog photography. A great first step is to shoot and process black-and-white film, then scan the results and work with the images in a computer. After you've done that, it's time for the next step: setting up your own darkroom and making black-and-white enlargements. In this course, photographer and educator Konrad Eek builds on his Shooting and Processing Black-and-White Film course to show the equipment, steps, and techniques involved in setting up a darkroom and making your own prints. From essential gear and setup considerations to processing techniques, this course is a complete introduction to the pleasures of black-and-white printing.
