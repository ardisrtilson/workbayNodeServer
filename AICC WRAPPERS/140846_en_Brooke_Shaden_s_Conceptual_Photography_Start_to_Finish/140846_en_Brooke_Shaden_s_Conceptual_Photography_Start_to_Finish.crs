[Course_Description]
Some photographers are driven to capture the world as it is; Brooke Shaden wants to capture the world as it isn't. Her work—exhibited in galleries nationwide—is inspired by empty rooms and open vistas, which she fills with otherworldly imagery, pieced together in Adobe Photoshop. In this episode of Start to Finish, Brooke shows us how she creates her painterly, painstakingly crafted images, starting with the very first proof-of-concept sketch. We follow her on location as she styles and poses her model, explains how she introduces props, and shoots just the few frames she needs to fulfill her concept. She then composites the image in Photoshop, reconstructing the room in which the image was shot, adding the model, and layering in creative color and texture. Along the way, she talks about developing the custom texture library and characteristic color profile that have become important hallmarks of her work.
