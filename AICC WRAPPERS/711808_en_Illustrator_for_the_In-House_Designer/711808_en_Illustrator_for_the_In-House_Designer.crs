[Course_Description]
Many companies are bringing design in-house for greater creative control and cost efficiency. However, you may find the role of an in-house designer is very different from that of a freelancer. There is a stronger emphasis on templates and styles, consistent file output, and shared workflows. This course helps designers transition their Illustrator skills to in-house design work, with a focus on efficiency, compatibility, and collaboration. Designer and creative consultant Tony Harmer shows how to produce graphics for print and digital display; work more effectively with Illustrator artboards, symbols, and layers; and prepare files for print production. Plus, learn about some useful Illustrator scripts and plugins to save you time on common design tasks, including sketching, halftone shading, and isometry. Watch Tony's companion course, Photoshop for the In-House Designer, to learn time-saving techniques using Photoshop templates, presets, brushes, and more.
