[Course_Description]
Research has shown that focusing only on maximizing profits has the paradoxical effect of reducing the rate of return on investment. Instead, organizations succeed in the long term through developing their capacity to innovate and adopting the strategy of focusing on employees, customers, and products first. In this course, one of eight in the Lean Technology Strategy series, Barry O'Reilly sets out why the clarity of communication and understanding of your organization's purpose is a key differentiator and indicator for higher engagement, alignment, and performance of your business. Learn what defines a purposeful organization, how to create alignment at scale, how to keep your team focused, and how to document your goals. This course was created by Barry O'Reilly. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
