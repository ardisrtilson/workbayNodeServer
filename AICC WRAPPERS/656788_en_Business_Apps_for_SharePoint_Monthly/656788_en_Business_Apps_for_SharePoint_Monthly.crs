[Course_Description]
In this series, Gini von Courter shows you how to build apps for SharePoint to solve common business needs. Each month, she introduces a new project, which you can customize to fit the unique requirements of your organization. The apps expand the functionality of SharePoint, making a more cloud-based work environment. All you need is the built-in tools in SharePoint and SharePoint Designerâ€”no programming knowledge is required. The series kicks off in October 2016 with an issue tracking app, perfect for managing helpdesk tickets and customer service requests. Follow-up projects include a promoted links list, an asset library, a phone call tracking app, landing pages, and a discussion board.
