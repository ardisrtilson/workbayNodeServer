[Course_Description]
Mindset has a huge performance impact—but leaders rarely stop to see how they can intentionally change their mindsets to get better results. Discover the transformative power your mindset can have on your leadership style and find out how you can identify, grow, and put new mindsets into work. Together with Stanford University, organizational psychologist Sesil Pir has studied how frames of reference impact relationships and outcomes and how successful leaders adapt their thought patterns to improve employee engagement, drive meaning across the organization, and promote life-long learning. This short course can help you leverage new findings to transform your own mindset and experience—and inspire new mindsets in others while driving innovation and sustainable business development results.
