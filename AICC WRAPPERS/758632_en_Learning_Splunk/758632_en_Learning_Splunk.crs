[Course_Description]
Splunk is a tool for analyzing and searching incoming machine-generated data like application or database logs. It is ideal for monitoring the health of IT infrastructure, especially networks with complex and aging systems, and software in production. In this course you can learn the basics of how Splunk works and how it can help you monitor data from multiple systems: web servers, databases, applications, and even cloud-based resources. Explore the search and reporting features, and learn how to set up alerts so that you can catch potential problems before they become critical. Plus, learn how to set up dashboards for visual insights into the state of your systems. Instructor Josh Samuelson illustrates the lessons with examples from real-world scenarios, where Splunk is used for centralized logging and reporting from multiple systems.
