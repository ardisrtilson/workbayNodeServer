[Course_Description]
Media and entertainment companies spend billions of dollars every year on creative talent. In this course—specifically designed for creatives—professor, contract attorney, indie film producer, and musician Seth Polansky pulls back the curtain and explains how to protect yourself when presented with an industry contract. Get an overview of the types of contracts that you can expect to see, the situations in which a particular type is used, and the specific red flags inherent in each. Seth discusses NDA, work-for-hire and contractor agreements, and proposals, quotes, and SOWs.
