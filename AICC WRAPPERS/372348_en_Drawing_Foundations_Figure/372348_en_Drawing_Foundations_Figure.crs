[Course_Description]
Learn the foundations of figure drawing: techniques for bringing the human form to life on paper. Artist and teacher Amy Wynne breaks down a classical approach to figure drawing into simple steps: capturing gesture and motion, mapping out structure and form, understanding the common landmarks of the body, drawing proportionally, and adding volume with shapes and shadows. Filmed on premise in a professional art studio, this course shows how to work with live models and different drawing materials. It's ideal for beginners who are just learning to draw the human figure as well as experienced artists who want to brush up their drawing skills. Follow along with Amy's tutorials and then use the worksheets and sample poses in the exercise files to practice figure drawing in your own time.
