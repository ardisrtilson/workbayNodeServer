[Course_Description]
Video is king on social media. But each platform has different recommendations for content, aesthetic, and length, as well as different delivery specs. In this course, senior staff instructor Ashley Kennedy teaches you how to repurpose your videos to best match the suggestions and specifications for each platform and each audience—so that you can save time and optimize your reach and impact. Learn how to create high-quality base videos and explore general repurposing strategies you can perform in post. Ashley shows how to adjust style, branding, length, aspect ratio, and other specifications to tailor videos for a specific destination. You can also examine how to extract multimedia elements from your videos—like still images, text, and audio—to repurpose your content in other ways across social media.
