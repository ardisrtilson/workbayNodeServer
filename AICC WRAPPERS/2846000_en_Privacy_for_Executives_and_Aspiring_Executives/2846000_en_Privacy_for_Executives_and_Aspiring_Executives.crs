[Course_Description]
Privacy is top of mind for all of today's business leaders, because it is getting attention from regulators, media, privacy activists, and customers. However, amid a profusion of laws, product offerings by vendors, and media coverage, executives often struggle to get clear guidance and options on how to execute a privacy program. This course helps C-level leaders, their deputies, and other aspiring executives develop an understanding of the privacy landscape and capabilities and build a program to stay ahead of the curveâ€”while continuing to grow their business. Instructor Nishant Bhajaria provides strategies to build a program that will be flexible and measurable. Such a program will involve a team that can manage risks in partnership with the rest of the business, provide solutions, measure progress, and inform decision-making. After taking this course, executives will have a template to not just start their teams, but also embed them into the business.
