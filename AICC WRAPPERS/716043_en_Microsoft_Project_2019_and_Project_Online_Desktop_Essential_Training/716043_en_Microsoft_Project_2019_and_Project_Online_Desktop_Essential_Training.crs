Learn how to master Microsoft Project, the world's leading project management software. This training course covers Project 2019 and Project Online Desktop, the subscription version of the desktop app. Bonnie Biafore, PMP, begins by showing how to set up a project and components such as work tasks, summary tasks, milestones, recurring tasks, and different types of resources. Next, she shows how to link and time tasks, assign resources to tasks to build a realistic project schedule, and use views to get an accurate window into project status. She also explains how to use Project to help evaluate your schedule and resource workloads to make sure you're bringing a project in on time and within budget. Plus, learn how to create and run reports and share project information with others.
