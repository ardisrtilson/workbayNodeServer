[Course_Description]
Technical information can be dry and hard to understand. But that doesnâ€™t mean your presentation has to be. Storytelling can transform technical talks into dynamic and energizing presentations. In this course, you can learn the top reasons why audiences tune out and discover techniques to make your complex material more memorable and engaging. Instructors Poornima Vijayashanker and Karen Catlin share how to improve your public speaking skills and use storytelling to increase engagement and retention. They show how to identify a story to use, build credibility with your story, and test it to make sure it will engage your audience. The course is filled with real-world examples that show how these lessons impact actual audiences.
