[Course_Description]
Making a product real involves starting with an idea, evolving the product through a prototype, and then making many copies of the final design. A lot happens between those last two steps, and this course examines those phases. Instructor Scott Clear covers the different ways you can prototype a new product, discusses the types of resources available to you, and explains how products evolve from prototypes to manufactured objects. Throughout the course, he puts these concepts in context by conducting interviews with experts in prototyping and manufacturing.
