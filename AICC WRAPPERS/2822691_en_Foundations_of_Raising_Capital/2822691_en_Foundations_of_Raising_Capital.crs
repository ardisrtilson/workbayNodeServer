[Course_Description]
For many businesses, success is dependent on raising the capital necessary to fund the business to a point of profitabilityâ€”and that capital can come from a variety of sources. In this course, explore several different methods for raising capital for your business, including loans, accelerator programs, crowdfunding, and venture capital. Instructor Jay Clouse sets you up for success by covering what to do before you pursue investment options, explaining who invests in businesses, why they do it, and how to convince them to invest in yours. Jay shares tips for constructing a presentation to support your pitch, as well as building effective relationships with potential investors. And throughout the course, he delves into both traditional funding options, such as banks and angel investors, and newer alternative forms of funding.
