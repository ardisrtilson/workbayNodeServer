[Course_Description]
How can you communicate information more visually? Instructor Amy Balliett has you covered. In this course, she introduces you to 20 rules that go into the “why,” the “who,” and the “how” of effective visual communication. For example, with Rule 3: Commit to quality, Amy shows you how to determine what makes content high quality and offers you a simple test to determine if your visual content meets or exceeds standards. With Rule 8: Different problems have different solutions, she discusses how to identify the right creative content solution for the problem that you’re trying to address with visual content. Throughout the course, Amy’s rules step through practical strategies and useful details that empower you to revolutionize your own content and brand strategy. Amy also explains which rules can be broken and how to break them.
