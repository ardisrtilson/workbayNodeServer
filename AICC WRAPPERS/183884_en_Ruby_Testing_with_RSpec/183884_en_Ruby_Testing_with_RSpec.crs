[Course_Description]
Learn how to use RSpec, the Ruby testing framework that can help developers be more productive, write better code, and reduce bugs during development. Kevin Skoglund explains the basic syntax of RSpec and then dives straight into writing and running test examples. He shows how to use a variety of matchers to test for expected conditions, provides techniques for testing efficiently, and demonstrates how test doubles can stand in for objects and methods. He also explains the additional RSpec features available for Ruby on Rails, and walks through a step-by-step example of test-driven development.
