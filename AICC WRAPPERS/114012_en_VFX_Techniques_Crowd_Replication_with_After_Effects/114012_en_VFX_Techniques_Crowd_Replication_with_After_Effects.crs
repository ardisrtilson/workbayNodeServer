[Course_Description]
VFX Techniques introduces common yet critical visual effects techniques that are used in film and television shows on a regular basis. This installment shows how to simulate a large crowd by combining live-action footage of a small group of people, 3D renders, and Adobe Photoshop artworkâ€”transforming an otherwise empty building into a rapt audience. Author Lee Lanier uses After Effects to set up image sequences, apply motion tracking to match the motion of the original camera, and key green-screen footage. Finally, you'll learn how to make all the elements cohesive with color correction and lighting techniques.
