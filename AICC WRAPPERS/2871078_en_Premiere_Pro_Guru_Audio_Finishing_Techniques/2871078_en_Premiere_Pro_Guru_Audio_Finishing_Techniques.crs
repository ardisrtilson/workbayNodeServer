As an editor, you need to know how to mix and sweeten audio yourself, as well as hand off tracks for others to finesse. In this installment of the Premiere Pro Guru series, Luisa Winters shares practical techniques for finishing the audio side of a project using Premiere Pro and Adobe Audition. Luisa explores a variety of topics, including track vs. clip level control, mastering the audio mixers, using submixes and automation modes, and working with the Essential Sound panel. Plus, explore restorative techniques with Adobe Audition, as well as how to output audio from Premiere Pro. This course was created by Rhed Pixel. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
