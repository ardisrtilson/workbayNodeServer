[Course_Description]
You hear experienced photographers say it all the time: shoot raw format to get the best quality. But what does raw really mean? Does it guarantee better image quality? And where does the DNG format come into play? In this course, photographer and educator Ben Long shines a light on what it means to shoot in rawâ€”and what it doesn't. Learn the benefits of shooting in raw, learn when your camera's RAW+JPEG mode makes more sense, and get insights into why some people prefer certain raw conversion software over others.
