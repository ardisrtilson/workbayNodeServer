Leaders don't always get to plan for change. More than ever, change is suddenly thrust upon businesses, forcing managers and executives to quickly acclimate and lead decisively. This course was designed to meet these leaders where they are. Instructor Scott Mautz covers what it takes to lead brilliantly during uncertain times. Scott shares what to focus on to produce the biggest impact, as well as how to establish a sense of control while doing so. He also explains how to exude a helpful, productive vibe as a leader, as well as achieve the five core competencies of change leadership to inspire and guide your team. Along the way, Scott shares real-life examples of leaders navigating emergent changes.
