By changing how we think about making decisions under pressure, we can remain effective leaders, even during times of crisis. In this course, Becki Saltzman shares how to leverage stress to your advantage, getting the pressure to work for you instead of against you when you need to think of options and determine what to do. She explains how to uncover hidden options, consider potential outcomes, and move forward with making a decision. Find out how to calculate costs, avoid the pitfalls of consensus-driven decisions, and successfully make strong judgment calls. Ultimately, she helps you to prevent stress from becoming the enemy of good decisions.
