[Course_Description]
You have a small core modular or semi-modular synth, and you're wondering: What should I add next to grow the capabilities of my system? And how can I get the most out of what I buy? In this extensive course, synth designer Chris Meyer reveals the important utility or glue modules you need to expand a core system such as a Moog Mother-32, and then explores a selection of the wide range of modules available in the Eurorack modular synthesizer format. Each chapter on a module type—such as oscillators, filters, modulators, and more—starts with a general movie showing you what features to look for in a module and how to patch it into your system, and then dives into three contrasting, representative examples of modules available inside that category. Along the way, Chris reveals a wide variety of synthesis tricks and techniques for the performer or sound designer, with styles ranging from melodic to dance to noise/industrial. This course has been designed as the logical follow-up to the original Learning Modular Synthesis or Learning Modular Synthesis: Moog Mother-32 courses, and should be helpful to a wide range of modular synthesists.
