He then shifts his focus to the particular challenge of inclusivity in tech. Learn why and how managers should build on recruitment processes to create a more diverse workforce. Discover how to keep inclusivity in mind when interviewing candidates. Plus, Nishant shares a personal story on how to best navigate building an inclusive team.
