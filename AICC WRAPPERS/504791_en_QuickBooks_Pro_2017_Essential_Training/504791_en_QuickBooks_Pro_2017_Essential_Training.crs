[Course_Description]
Even if you're not an accountant, understanding the basics of QuickBooks Pro 2017 is an empowering—and in some cases, essential—skill. In this course, Jess Stratton shows you how to create and back up your company's QuickBooks file and quickly set up shop by adding all of your financial accounts. In addition, learn about adding products and inventory items. Once you're all set up, Jess walks you through the day-to-day operations that keep your business running: creating estimates and purchase orders, sending invoices, processing payments, and printing checks. Plus, learn how to run reports, find data about your business, and manage end-of-year preparations.
