[Course_Description]
Digital drawing is made easier with SketchBook Pro, whether you're an illustrator a CAD designer involved in manufacturing. In this course, Veejay Gahir shares reference images and techniques he's developed over years as a professional product and automotive designer. He'll walk you through SketchBook's basics—the interface, preferences, brushes, Lagoon tools, and export options—so you can get started sketching quickly. He'll also introduce alternative workflows to achieve the same results, which may better suit your style of working. Your final sketches can then be used downstream in other CAD programs or simply saved and shared. And don't miss the four drawing tutorials to see Veejay sketching in action!
