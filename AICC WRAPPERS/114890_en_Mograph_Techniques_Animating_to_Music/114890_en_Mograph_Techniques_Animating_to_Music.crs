[Course_Description]
Harmonize your motion graphics with music. This project-based course shows how to complete two mograph assignments, a bumper graphic and identity spot, and explains how to transition the tools and techniques to your own projects. Author Ian Robinson starts in Adobe After Effects with Trapcode Sound Keysâ€”isolating frequencies and creating related keyframes that allow you to drive properties like the position, rotation, or even the hue of an object. Then learn traditional editing techniques to transform a 3D animation into multiple pieces for the bumper, and migrate to CINEMA 4D and use the Sound Effector to resolve the logo for the identity spot.
