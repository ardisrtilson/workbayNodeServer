[Course_Description]
Leadership is a language of the heart. You want to motivate and inspire, not just talk. In this course, adapted from the podcast How to Be Awesome at Your Job, communications expert and pitch champion Chris Westfall explains how to communicate to achieve connection and results. Chris states that there are three ways that people listen: listening to confirm what they know, listening like a lawyer, and listening to discover something new. He explains how to harness these habits—in combination with “you” language—to achieve what you want. Plus, learn how to phrase your goals and desires in terms of their impact on others, in order to engage your team in initiatives that affect them. This course was created by Pete Mockaitis of How to Be Awesome at Your Job. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
