Moving to the C-Suite requires a shift in mindset. The paradox is that it means leading less and delegating more, to create an environment where people are inspired to do their best. For those transitioning from leading others to leading the organization, this course offers tips to adapt to the realities of an executive role and move your leadership abilities forward. Learn how to inspire confidence, delegate work, identify talent, lead multiple generations, and build a company vision, strategy, and culture. Consultant and former CEO Jan Rutherford provides new tips that will help you succeed in a new C-Suite role.
