Got a room with a view? Make the most of it: set up your camera to shoot a time-lapse movie. It's a great way to capture the unfolding of time when you're on a vacation or business trip, or to capture the drama of passing storms on a rainy day. In this course, Richard Harrington details the steps behind shooting great time-lapses from a window, including how to avoid window reflections and glare. The course also includes gear and file-format advice as well as tips for assembling the shots into a finished movie. This course was created by RHED Pixel.
