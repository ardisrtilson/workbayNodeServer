[Course_Description]
“Diversity and inclusion” has become such a familiar phrase that it’s easy to lose sight of what it means. Workplaces that incorporate a wide range of human experience—across gender, culture, age, sexual orientation, and other differences—are more adaptable and more innovative places to work than their more homogeneous competitors. Not surprisingly, they do better on recruitment, retention, productivity—basically any measure of success you can think of. This course explains how to improve your organization's diversity and inclusion by thoughtfully examining the challenges and opportunities they present. Learn how to support a diverse workforce through wise management, carefully structured conversations, and a culture designed to celebrate the unique value of each team member. This course includes videos from: Jane Hyun, an internationally renowned executive coach and leadership strategist Kathryn Minshew, founder and CEO of The Muse, a career discovery platform Wendy Luhabe, South African social entrepreneur Nilofer Merchant, marketing expert and TED speaker (“Sitting Is the Smoking of Our Generation”) Claire Groen, vice president of litigation and deputy general counsel at Amway Note: This course was produced by Big Think.
