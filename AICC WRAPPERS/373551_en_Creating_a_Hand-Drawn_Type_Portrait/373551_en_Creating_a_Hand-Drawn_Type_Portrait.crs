[Course_Description]
Watch a professional artist at work, Von Glitschka, as he creates a type-based portrait, or type face, of director Alfred Hitchcock. The process combines analog and digital tools to draw the letterforms from scratch and build and colorize the artwork in its final vector form. Along the way, Von examines reference images of Hitchcock, makes sketches on the iPad in Adobe Draw, moves the artwork into Adobe Illustrator, and finishes the piece with color and shading.
