[Course_Description]
Security devices on a network scoop up traffic and then analyze the field values to allow or deny specific traffic. As smart as the devices are, there are times when some threats slip through the cracks. Wireshark is a free protocol analysis tool that is used to baseline a network, actively monitor changes, identify common attack signatures, build firewall rules, detect issues, and quickly remove threats from the network. This course covers how to use Wireshark for deep packet analysis, capturing, and forensics. Learn how to keep your networks secure against malware and cyberattacks by implementing solutions that detect and handle unusual traffic.
