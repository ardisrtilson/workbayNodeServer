[Course_Description]
One way to learn animation is an all-in-one course, the kind you can find here in our library. The other path is on-the-job training, and involves picking up tips and tricks as you work. This course will give you that on the job experience in weekly doses. Every Tuesday, instructor Dermot O' Connor reveals a tip or trick that animation professionals use to save time and create more compelling characters. Learn to use delays, overshoots, and leading gestures to create looser, more realistic movement; draw different mouth shapes for male and female characters; create different styles of walks such as staggers; and more. Note: Because this is an ongoing series, viewers will not receive a certificate of completion.
