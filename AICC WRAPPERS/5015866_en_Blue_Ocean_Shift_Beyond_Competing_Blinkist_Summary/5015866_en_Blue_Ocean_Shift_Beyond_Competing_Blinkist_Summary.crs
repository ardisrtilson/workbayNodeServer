[Course_Description]
Many business leaders feel resigned to aggressively fending off competitors in their rise to the top. But in their 2017 book, Blue Ocean Shift, W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne posit that it doesn't have to be that way. In fact, they suggest that it's often smarter to steer your organization away from a fiercely competitive space (or a red ocean) and move instead towards a new market with abundant opportunities (a blue ocean). In this audiobook summary, get tips and tools gleaned from Blue Ocean Shift that can help you strategically navigate into your very own blue ocean. Explore how a blue ocean strategist thinks, how to uncover customers' hidden pain points, how to infuse your company—and its shift—with humanness, and more.
