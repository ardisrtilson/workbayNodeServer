[Course_Description]
Sony Vegas Pro bundles three programs, each of which serve a key purpose in the video production workflow. Vegas is at its heart, while Sound Forge takes your production audio to a professional level and DVD Architect helps you to get your video to the people who want to see it. Steve Grisetti shows how footage makes its way through each of these programs in the typical workflow for a professional-quality movie. Follow along as he takes a batch of raw video clips and assembles them into a scene in Vegas, performs audio sweetening and cleanup in Sound Forge, and prepares the final project in DVD Architect for output as a DVD or Blu-ray disc.
