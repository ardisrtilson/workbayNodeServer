[Course_Description]
On the eve of Photoshop's 25th anniversary, we asked early adopters and pioneering artists to tell us their Photoshop stories. Here photographer Chris Orwig explains his relationship to Photoshop and photography: from a second chance after a painful accident to a practice that renews and challenges him every day. Chris also explains his less is more approach to photo editing, which lets the tool fade into the background and the story shine through.
