Every novice photographer hears always shoot with the sun to your back. And every experienced photographer knows that this is bad advice. When you shoot into the sun—or any other light source—you expand your creative options dramatically. Backlighting can add drama to almost any subject, from leaves to hair, to smoke, to glassware. In this course, photographer, author, and educator Ben Long explores the creative options and exposure challenges behind backlighting in several difference scenarios, from landscapes to portraits, using both natural and artificial light sources.
