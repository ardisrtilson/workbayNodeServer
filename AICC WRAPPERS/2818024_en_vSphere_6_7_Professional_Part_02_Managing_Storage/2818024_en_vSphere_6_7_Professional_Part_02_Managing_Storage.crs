[Course_Description]
VMware vSphere is an integral part of any modern networking environment. vSphere offers a virtualized data center that helps administrators scale infrastructure to meet business needs. This course is the second in a nine-part series designed to teach you all the essentials of configuring, managing, securing, and troubleshooting a vSphere 6.7 environment with the new HTML5 vSphere Client. In this course, instructor Rick Crisci reviews the foundations of virtual storage in vSphere, including working with storage commands (SCSI), NFS and VMFS data stores, ESXi, Storage DRS and vSAN clusters, and Virtual Volumes. By the end of the course, you should be able to configure and manage a robust and secure virtual storage solution for your organization. Note: This series is also designed to prepare candidates for the VMware Certified Professional - Data Center Virtualization 2019 (VCP-DCV 2019) exam. This course was created by Rick Crisci. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
