[Course_Description]
If you don't understand the basics of how your nervous system works, it can get the best of you, especially in stressful situations. In this course, somatic expert and coach Jay Fields teaches specific practices for regulating the autonomic nervous system, which unconsciously controls the fight-or-flight responses, like your breathing, heart rate, and sleep. While this course wonâ€™t magically make the world a safer and less stressful place, if you apply the lessons Jay imparts, you'll have more control over how you take on the challenges you do face, letting you experience more of the safety and harmony that does exist in the world.
