[Course_Description]
Tech is one of those rare places where demand for jobs is higher than the supply. With that in mind, how can recruiters and hiring managers get the best candidates for the job into the jobs theyâ€™re trying to fill? One way is by understanding the tech well enough to know exactly what you need. In this series of courses, instructor Ayub Shaikh goes over high-level IT concepts and breaks them into related, easy-to-remember groupings. This course focuses specifically on waterfall, agile, and DevOps. First, Ayub explains the waterfall model, its strengths, its drawbacks, and how those drawbacks led to the development of the agile model. Next, he introduces you to the agile manifesto, key principles of agile development, and how you can identify and recruit agile candidates. Ayub concludes with a discussion of devops, including how it combines two separate silos of IT skills and how you can find and recruit devops candidates.
