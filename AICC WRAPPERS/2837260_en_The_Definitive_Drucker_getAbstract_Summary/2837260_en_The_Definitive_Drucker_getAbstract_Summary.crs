[Course_Description]
Peter Drucker is called the father of modern management for good reason, according to management consultant Elizabeth Haas Edersheim. Her book The Definitive Drucker—an accessible volume of his business lessons—demonstrates that Drucker's theories were the perfect combination of calculated common sense and genuine concern for the human side of consumers and employees. His teachings struck the right balance between big-picture dreaming and detail-oriented drudgery. In The Definitive Drucker, Elizabeth applies Drucker's business lessons to today's ever-shifting landscape of globalization and fragmentation. This audio-only summary of her book, produced by getAbstract, breaks down some of Drucker's most salient insights for marketers and managers who want to learn from the best. This audiobook summary was created by getAbstract, the world’s largest provider of business book summaries. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
