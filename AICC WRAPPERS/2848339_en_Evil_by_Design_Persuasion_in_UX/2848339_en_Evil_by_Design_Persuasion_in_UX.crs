[Course_Description]
Design is communication. But a thoughtfully designed UI can do more than just communicate a user's options. It can also persuade users, nudging them down whatever path the designer had in mind. And this persuasive power can be used for both good and nefarious purposes. In this course, the first installment in the series based on his book Evil by Design, Chris Nodder provides an overview of persuasive design and its ethical implications, focusing on how to positively integrate persuasive design into products. Chris delves into the science of human behavior and how it applies to user experience and design. He explores how design can appeal to direct emotions and cause very targeted and predictable responses from people. Plus, he digs into the different types of dark patterns you may encounter and leverage in your projects, as well as how far you can take those designs while still remaining a force for good. Whether you're a software developer looking to design persuasive interfaces—or a consumer curious about how persuasive techniques work—this course can serve to enlighten and inform.
