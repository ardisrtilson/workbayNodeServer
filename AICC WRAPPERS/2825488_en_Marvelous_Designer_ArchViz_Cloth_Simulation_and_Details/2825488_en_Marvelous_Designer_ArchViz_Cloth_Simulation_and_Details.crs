[Course_Description]
Marvelous Designer is a purpose-built cloth simulation tool that has become critical for creating realistic architectural and product visualizations. In this course, ArchViz expert Verena Tatiana shows you how to create fabrics in a variety of uses, in an architectural setting, using Marvelous Designer. Verena introduces you to the Marvelous Designer interface and tools. She steps you through a series of projects with cloth simulations: a couch with a throw blanket and a pillow, a curtain, bedding, and a chair cushion. Each project highlights different ways you can drape, pattern, and detail fabrics. Verena concludes by showing you how to export the models you have made.
