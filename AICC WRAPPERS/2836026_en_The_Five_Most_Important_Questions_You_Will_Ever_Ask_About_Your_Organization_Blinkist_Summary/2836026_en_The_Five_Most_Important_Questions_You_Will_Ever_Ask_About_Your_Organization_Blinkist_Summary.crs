In this audiobook summary, discover how to refine your organization's mission—and boost your company's chances of success—by asking the right questions. Learn how to assess your organization's purpose, identify your primary and supporting customers, determine your customers' values, analyze both qualitative and quantitative results for your business, and create an actionable plan for change. Each lesson is drawn from The Five Most Important Questions You Will Ever Ask About Your Organization, the 2008 book by Peter F. Drucker. Note: This audiobook summary was produced by Blinkist.
