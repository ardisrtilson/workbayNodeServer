[Course_Description]
Shiny allows R data science teams to build interactive data-driven web apps without needing to learn HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. It is a powerful and versatile tool that is often used for R&D, data analysis, and even external marketing purposes. If you have a good understanding of the R language and know how to separate client-side code from server-side, you are ready to dive into this course and build a Shiny app. Martin John Hadley covers organizing single and split-file apps, managing data tables, using APIs to get data into an app, adding data controls, deploying an app, and more.
