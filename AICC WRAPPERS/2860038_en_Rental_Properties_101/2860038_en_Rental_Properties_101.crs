[Course_Description]
Investing in rental property is a time-tested strategy for building wealth in real estate. Contrary to popular opinion, generating passive rental income does not require you to deal with tenants, handle repairs, or even see the property in person. Nor does it require a major capital investment or prior real estate experience. All you need is a reliable system for finding the right rental properties, putting quality management in place, and structuring “hands-off” real estate deals that deliver consistent income each and every month. In this WealthFit course, you can learn how to buy your first cash-flowing rental the right way. Explore the pros—and the cons—of real estate investing and decide if it's right for you. Then discover how to identify your target market, use a deal analyzer to analyze properties, and get a hands-on approach to proactive vs. passive rentals. By the end of this course, you'll have the knowledge you need to kickstart your first rental investment. This course was created by WealthFit. We are pleased to host this content in our library.
