[Course_Description]
The individuals and organizations that succeed are the ones who are laser focused on the customer. Even if you're not in a customer-facing role, knowing how your job connects to your customers gives you a better frame for strategic decision-making, and helps you feel more connected to the purpose of your job. This makes you feel more motivated and more fulfilled at work. In this course, Lisa Earle McLeod and Elizabeth McLeod help you connect the dots between your job and customer impact, and they provide strategies and behaviors for keeping your customers top of mind. They explain how to determine where you fit in your customer's world, and how to keep the focus on the customer when you talk about wins, goals, and mistakes. They also share strategies for sustaining your service mindset-even when your organization isn't particularly customer focused.
