[Course_Description]
If you're just perusing job boards, then you're only scratching the surface of open roles. A significant amount of positions end up going to professionals who were recruited via nontraditional means. A recruiter may have plucked a candidate from their own network, or found them via a referral from a trusted contact. In this course, instructor Aimee Bateman details how to navigate this hidden job market, so that you can find—and land—the jobs that aren't publicly advertised. Discover how to clearly define what you have to offer, leverage your network, use social media to your advantage, and more.
