[Course_Description]
The user interface is a visual display of the underlying computer system and the point of interaction for all users. To increase the productâ€™s usability, the appearance and behaviors should be well understood, easy to learn, and pleasing to use. The lessons in this course teach the proper role of color, type, iconography, illustrations, and micro-interactions when building an interface for any system. Instructor Diane Cronenwett reviews visual principles such as grouping and hierarchy, explains how and when to use iconography, discusses the importance and impact of color, and shows how to take designs further with illustration and animation. Plus, learn how important usability considerations such as legibility and accessibility should guide your design choices.
