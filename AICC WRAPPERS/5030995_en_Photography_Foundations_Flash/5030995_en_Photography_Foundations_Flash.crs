[Course_Description]
Harsh, unflattering lighting can ruin a photo—and with flash, it's easy to get harsh, unflattering lighting. But flash is a necessary part of a photographer's toolset—after all, the world doesn't always provide you with the best natural light. Fortunately, it isn't difficult to get great results from flash, and in this course, photographer, author, and teacher Ben Long details the concepts and techniques behind effective lighting with flash. Ben starts with the fundamentals, going over the anatomy of a flash and flash exposure. He shares tips for improving the results from a camera's built-in flash, and then focuses on creating great light with a handheld flash. The course also explores topics ranging from bouncing and syncing flash to shooting with one or more off-camera flash units.
