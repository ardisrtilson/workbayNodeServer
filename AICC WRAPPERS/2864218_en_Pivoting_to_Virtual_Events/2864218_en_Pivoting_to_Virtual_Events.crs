All good events can be used as a catalyst to achieve larger business objectives—that’s what makes them so powerful. By taking a formerly in-person event online, you can solve for those same business objectives while also creating a more inclusive and environmentally conscious experience. In this course, instructor Taylor Estes shows you how, providing tips for adjusting to this new format and crafting transformative online experiences for attendees and stakeholders. Taylor shares techniques for keeping your remote attendees engaged from start to finish, including how to pick the right presenters. Learn how to tell compelling stories through your virtual event, leverage the power of user-generated content to connect with attendees, and manage the overall production. Plus, Taylor digs into the business value of online events, explaining how they can give you a larger reach and effectively address the issue of sustainability.
