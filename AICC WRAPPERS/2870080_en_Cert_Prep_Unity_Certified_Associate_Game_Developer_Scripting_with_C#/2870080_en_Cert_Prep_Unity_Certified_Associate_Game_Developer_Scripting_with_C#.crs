[Course_Description]
Become Unity certified and show employers you have the Unity skills they are looking for. Improve your chances of landing that dream job doing what you love mostâ€”making games, architectural visualizations, or films. This course helps you study for the sections of the Unity Certified Associate: Game Developer exam that deal with scripting and publishing. Instructor Alan Thorn covers the basics of scripting, demonstrating how to create a C# script in Visual Studio, print to the console, and create useful scripts that make 3D objects move and react. He also discusses making timed behaviors, generating path-finding data for helping nonplayer characters (NPCs) navigate environments intelligently, and using finite-state machines to help NPCs make decisions. Plus, learn how to create convincing patrol, chase, and attack states for an enemy character.
