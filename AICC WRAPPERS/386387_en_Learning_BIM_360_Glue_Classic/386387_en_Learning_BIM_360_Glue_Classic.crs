[Course_Description]
BIM 360 Glue is the glue you need to connect your entire project team: everyone on the job, on the road, and in the office. In this course, Eric Wing helps get you up and running with this cloud-based BIM management software. He'll show how to create new projects, glue models from other CAD software such as AutoCAD and Revit, and manage, mark up, and clash models in BIM 360 Glue. Last but not least, he'll take a tour of the companion mobile app, which allows you to view the same drawings and models you see on your desktop on an iPad or iPhone.
