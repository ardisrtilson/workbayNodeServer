An administrative professional is often called the role with no job description, because the responsibilities can vary so much. When you support an executive, you need to be prepared to expect the unexpected. However, there are basic job duties and skills that most administrative professionals share. In this course, Aimee Reese reveals the secrets of seasoned and successful admins, and describes what the path looks like as you advance toward C-level executive support. She describes the interpersonal skills required, from working with colleagues and supporting multiple executives simultaneously, to working on a team and managing other admins. Plus, learn job-specific skills such as handling mail and email, managing a calendar, setting up flawless meetings, and using the latest technology.
