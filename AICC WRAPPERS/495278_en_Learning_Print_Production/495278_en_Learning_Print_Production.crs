[Course_Description]
Join author Claudia McCue on a journey that introduces the printing process and reveals the keys to designing a document that prints as well as it looks on screen. Learn about the life cycle of a print job and observe printing presses in action. Discover how to better communicate with your printer, think about print as you're designing, and choose the correct paper, inks, colors, and fonts for your project. The exercise files include a beautiful and varied example document, Maker Quarterly, from Mohak Fine Papers, that will help you understand how to create healthy files that print with no surprises. The course will help you and your printer produce a professionally finished print job, whether it's a business card, brochure, or multipage magazine, and catch print problems before they become catastrophes.
