[Course_Description]
Erin Shrimpton—business psychologist, coach, and expert in organizational behavior—helps you change the workplace experience on your team for the better. Erin first defines organizational culture and shows how you can put all of organizational culture into perspective to work on improving experiences. People are more likely to get behind change when they're the ones driving it. Erin teaches you about participatory action and how to start your culture change plan. Then, Erin walks you through a five-step plan designed to help you make culture changes that stick. Learn how to define a shared vision, analyze data to diagnose the aspects of culture you're trying to change, set up culture squads to create solutions to the issues you've identified, and more. Plus, Erin shares some thoughts on why culture change initiatives at the team level are such meaningful work.
