This course was designed to help you become a more confident and persuasive negotiator, so that you can get sellers to sell their property to you—and ultimately secure a good deal. Learn basic—but crucial—negotiation principles and tactics that you can start implementing right away. Discover techniques for projecting optimism and using humor in negotiation conversations, as well as how to avoid common mistakes that can derail your progress with sellers.
