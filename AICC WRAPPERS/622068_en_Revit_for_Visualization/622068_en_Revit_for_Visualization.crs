[Course_Description]
With an increase in real-time rendering programs, architectural and engineering firms are utilizing more detailed modeling practices. In this course, learn about several methods of using Revit to create graphics to present a model, or graphically display information contained in a model. Instructor William Carney covers visibility settings, graphic display options, and material creation. Plus, he discusses the annotation of three-dimensional views, and techniques for quickly creating graphic presentation images that change the way a model looks without changing what is modeled.
