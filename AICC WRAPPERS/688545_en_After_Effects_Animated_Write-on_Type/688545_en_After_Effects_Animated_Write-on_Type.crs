[Course_Description]
The write-on animation effect is a familiar one to most motion graphics artists. But making your animated flowing type appear seamless can be tricky. In this course, instructor Ran Ben Avraham provides a fresh take on this popular effect, sharing techniques that can help you take it several levels forward in Adobe After Effects. He begins by going over the familiar way of creating the write-on effect. Next, he breaks down the steps for a cleaner, more advanced solutionâ€”one in which the bits and pieces of your text won't be revealed ahead of time, regardless of the complexity of the font or text. Plus, learn how to add secondary animation to make your effect really stand out. The result is a delightful, quick, and springy write-on animation that will give your work a new boost.
