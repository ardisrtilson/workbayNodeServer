Leaders wear many hats. Sometimes you need to manage; sometimes you simply need to facilitate-to empower your teams to excel on their own. Executive coach Prakash Raman explains how facilitation skills can help you create high-performing, autonomous teams. He outlines how to develop the core skills of a facilitative leader, such as developing your emotional intelligence, active listening, asking powerful questions, engaging productive conflict, and being flexible in your own thinking so as to make room for your team's input. He concludes by outlining the most common challenges that leaders and managers face when using facilitation skills with their team.
