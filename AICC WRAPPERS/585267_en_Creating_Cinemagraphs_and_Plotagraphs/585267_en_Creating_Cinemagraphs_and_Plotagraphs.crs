[Course_Description]
Cinemagraphs are static photos that contain areas of motion. These specialized graphics—which are essentially high-end, animated GIFs—can be leveraged for dynamic advertising, or to help you stand out on social media. In this course, learn how to use Photoshop, After Effects, and other tools to explore the creative options of cinemagraphs. In addition, learn how to create plotagraphs with Plotagraph Pro, which allows you to create dynamic content from static photos. While plotagraphs are similar to cinemagraphs, the starting point and execution is very different. Join Rich Harrington as he walks through how to create cinemagraphs in a variety of different programs, and how to create plotagraphs with Plotagraph Pro. Throughout the course, Rich shares helpful shooting and post-production techniques to help you improve your end results.
