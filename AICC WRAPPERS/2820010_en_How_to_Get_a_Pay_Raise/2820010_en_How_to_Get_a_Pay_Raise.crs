Are you overdue for a pay raise? Sometimes you have to ask for what youâ€™re worth. However, asking for a salary increase can be a difficult conversation if you are unprepared. This course gives you the skills and confidence to get the pay raise you deserve. Aimee Bateman from Careercake explains how to set up the meeting, prepare your case, and respond to any questions your boss throws at you. By understanding your needs, researching the job market, and developing a compelling pitch, you can have a productive conversation that underscores your value to the company and results in the pay raise you deserve. This course was created by Careercake, the careers content platform. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
