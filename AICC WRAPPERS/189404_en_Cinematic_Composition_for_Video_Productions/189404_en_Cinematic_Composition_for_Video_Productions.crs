[Course_Description]
Composition is one of the least understood yet most important aspects of video. Like good storytelling, in order to achieve good video composition you have to make every detail count and keep the audience engaged in your story. In this course, Eduardo Angel breaks down effective cinematic composition, showing how to create different compositional effects using a variety of techniques. Beginning with basics such as shot size, depth of field, and the rule of thirds, Eduardo shows how to establish a scene, play with perspective and movement, and incorporate some of the most common shot types, including close-ups and group shots. Once you've learned the rules, see how to break them, using warped perspectives and intentionally confusing sequences, before exploring technical considerations such as lenses and lighting.
