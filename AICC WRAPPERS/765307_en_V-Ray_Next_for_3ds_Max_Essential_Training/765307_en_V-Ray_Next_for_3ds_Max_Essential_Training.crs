[Course_Description]
Get up and running with the V-Ray Next rendering engine inside 3ds Max. In this course, instructor Brian Bradley shows how to extend the range of 3ds Max using the many state-of-the-art tools and features found in this edition of the powerful rendering solution. Brian kicks off the course by covering several new tools included in V-Ray Next, including the Lighting Analysis tool and the Viewport IPR. He then dives into critical V-Ray concepts, including materials, image sampling, maps, and lighting, as well as how to create in-camera effects such as depth of field and motion blur. Plus, he shows how to easily add lifelike effects to your 3D models using FX tools such as VRayFur.
