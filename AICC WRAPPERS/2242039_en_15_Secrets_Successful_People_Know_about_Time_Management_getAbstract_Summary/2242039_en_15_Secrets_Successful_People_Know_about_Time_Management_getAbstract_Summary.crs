[Course_Description]
In his book, 15 Secrets Successful People Know About Time Management, Kevin Kruse—New York Times best-selling author and award-winning entrepreneur—combines his skills as a CEO and a journalist to search for common bonds of success by surveying people of great accomplishment. The billionaires, entrepreneurs, and Olympians he interviewed all said that they make the most of every minute, at work and at play. All high achievers regard time as an asset more valuable than money—and they spend every minute wisely. In this audio-only summary of his book, created by getAbstract, you can learn how top achievers manage their time, and why they emphasize the need for rest, exercise, and even fun. Discover how this practical advice can help you become more efficient and more successful. This audiobook summary was created by getAbstract, the world’s largest provider of business book summaries.
