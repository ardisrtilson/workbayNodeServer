[Course_Description]
If you want to animate a header, build banner ads, or create an infographic, Paul Trani can show you how—and he does—in this course using Adobe Animate CC. He demonstrates how to create graphics and text, import designs and photos, and bring objects to life using animation and interactivity. He also shows the publishing process for outputting to multiple platforms like HTML, SWF, SVG, and WebGL. Since the principles of creating and animating go beyond the featured projects and can be used in a number of scenarios, this course can help any web designer explore the robust capabilities of Adobe Animate CC.
