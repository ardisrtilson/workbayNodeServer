Logistics play a critical role in a company's success. In this course, professor Steven Brown explains the role (and importance) of logistics, from factory to customer and supplier to factory. He also covers some key decisions, processes, and strategies: Do you make products or buy them? What kind of transportation do you use? Where are your warehouses? How do you manage inventory? And what information system do you use? These lessons will help you understand the importance of logistics and help your company prepare for efficient delivery, distribution, and inventory. Plus, get insights on the latest logistics trends.
