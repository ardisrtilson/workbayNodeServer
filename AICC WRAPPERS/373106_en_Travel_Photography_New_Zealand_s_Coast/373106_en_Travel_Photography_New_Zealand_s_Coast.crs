[Course_Description]
There is no off-season for landscape photography. Even winter offers unique image-making opportunities. Follow along with landscape photographer Justin Reznick as he travels to the stormy Punakaiki coast, a beach on the South Island of New Zealand well known for its Pancake Rocks. By taking advantage of breaks in the weather, Justin captures incredible photographs of the ocean waves, rock formations, and stormy skies. Along the way, he'll teach viewers how to experiment with shutter speed and long exposures, isolate subjects with a telephoto lens, take multiple bracketed exposures, and more. At the end of each chapter, he reviews images from the shoot and demos his post-processing workflow in Lightroom.
