[Course_Description]
It's critical for customer success managers (CSMs) to have a solid understanding of how businesses work and how value is created and measured, yet relatively few CSMs ever receive training on this vital subject. This course can help CSMs quickly get up to speed by providing a primer on the fundamentals of business management. Learn about the connections between customer success and business awareness, the reasons why businesses exist, how businesses create value, and how expenditure and profits are calculated. Review how businesses work in terms of how they are organized, what they do, what resources they need, and what relationships they have with other entities. Plus, learn about the principles of business management, including how and why change occurs within a business and how business strategy is formulated and applied. This course can be taken on its own, or as one in a series from PracticalCSM.com that build upon each other to cover CSM best practices in greater detail.
