Become visually literate—gaining the ability to identify and describe the elements of a successful image—to improve how you capture and edit photos. By learning how to evaluate photographs, you can help elevate the quality of images taken by yourself and others. This course is designed to increase your ability to recognize what works and what doesn't work when it comes to achieving a successful composition. Join Steve Simon as he deconstructs images through critique. Grow your awareness of the impact your choices make on the interpretation of an image. Enhance your command of shutter speed, depth of field, focal plane, and more, to help convey a specific meaning. Learn how to study, review, and analyze images, sharpening your photographic eye and expanding your visual vocabulary.
