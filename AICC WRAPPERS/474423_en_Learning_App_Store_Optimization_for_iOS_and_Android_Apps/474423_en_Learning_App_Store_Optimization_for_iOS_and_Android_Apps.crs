[Course_Description]
You've written an app and are ready to send it out into the world. But with the 4+ million apps available for iOS and Android, you can't just press Publish and hope for a hit. To get apps in front of bigger audiences, developers can borrow tips and best practices from the SEO and marketing world. App store optimization (ASO) can help increase your app's ranking, make it more visible in search results, and make it more appealing to potential customers. And you don't have to change a lot of code. ASO is all about the words you use, the metadata you assign, the links you identify, and the visuals you choose. Join app developer and marketer Mike Wong as he shares his tips for marketing apps in the App Store and Google Play, using keyword research, indexing, deep linking, outstanding visuals, and other ASO techniques.
