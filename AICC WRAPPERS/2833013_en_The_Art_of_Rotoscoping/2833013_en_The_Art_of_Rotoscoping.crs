[Course_Description]
Turn your video footage into a work of art. Learn the basics of rotoscoping to build creative effects and to isolate video elements for compositing or VFX. In this course, instructor and mograph artist Eran Stern starts by diving the history and origin of rotoscoping in film and video, providing the background for subsequent practical techniques. He shows how to transform video into natural artâ€”from pencil sketches to Van Gogh paintings, claymation to chalkboard drawings, watercolors to graffiti, and ink blots, Legos, comic books, pastels, and much more. You can also find out how to use the same foundational techniques to isolate elements for compositing and visual effects work, and create simple character animations. Plus, explore the different software for rotoscoping, from Photoshop and After Effects to professional applications such as Mocha AE.
