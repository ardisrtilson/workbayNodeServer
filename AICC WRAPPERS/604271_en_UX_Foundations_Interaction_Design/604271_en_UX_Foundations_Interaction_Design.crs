[Course_Description]
Engaging, easy-to-use products don't appear fully formed in the minds of designers and product teams: they're the result of careful consideration, exploration, and study. Interaction designers are crucial players in the product design process, because they observe human behavior and use what they've learned to craft products that meet people's specific needs. In this course, join instructor David Hogue as he steps through the foundational processes and techniques required for interaction design. David begins by taking a look at key psychology concepts and how they can help us better understand how our people think, feel, and behave. He then takes a deeper dive into the methods and processes used by interaction designers to create considerate, engaging, and valuable products. Learn about the dimensions of interaction design, design thinking, design patterns, usability and accessibility, and more.
