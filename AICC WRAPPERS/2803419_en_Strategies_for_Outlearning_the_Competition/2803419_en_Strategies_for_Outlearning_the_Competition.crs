[Course_Description]
The martial language of business—all that talk about wins and crushing the competition—can be counterproductive and misleading. The truth is expertise and success are the result of learning. You don’t have to beat your competitors; you can outlearn them. From adopting a healthy learning mindset, to understanding the cognitive processes of learning in the brain, to systematizing learning within your organization, this course teaches you the only skill you’ll ever need to master: how to learn. A diverse range of experts, from Parks and Rec actor Nick Offerman to award-winning journalist and entrepreneur Shane Snow, explain how to arm yourself with the tools to understand how you and your organization learn and to take your own learning to the next level. This course includes videos from: Nick Offerman, writer, woodworker, and actor (Parks and Rec) Shane Snow, science and business journalist and the cofounder of Contently Barbara Oakley, professor of engineering at Oakland University in Rochester, MI John Seely Brown, former director of Xerox PARC and current USC advisor Jamie Wheal, leading expert on the neurophysiology of human performance, Flow Genome Project Note: This course was produced by Big Think.
