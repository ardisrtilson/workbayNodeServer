Don't get caught up in lighting and camera work and neglect the interview itself. Producer Rich Harrington and communication specialist Amy DeLouise team up to show you how the pros prepare for, organize, and conduct great video interviews. Learn about performing background research before you set foot on set, positioning the subject in front of the camera, building trust, avoiding common mistakes in questioning, capturing secondary audio for use in a podcast, and much more. Amy brings years of interviewing expertise to this important subject, while Rich offers tips that will help make editing easier and reduce the amount of money spent in post-production.
