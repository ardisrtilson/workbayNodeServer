OneNote is a robust note-taking app that allows you to jot down and save your ideas—from thoughts hastily scribbled on napkins to saved articles on the web—and cross tag them for easy recall. In this course, instructor Heather Severino—a OneNote MVP and Microsoft Certified Trainer—offers tips to help you be even more organized and productive with this powerful tool. Heather covers top power shortcuts, explains how to set up and organize your notebooks, shares tips for taking better notes and improving the look of your notes, and goes into how to import content from other apps.
