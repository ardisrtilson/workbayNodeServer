[Course_Description]
Microsoft Paint 3D brings 3D design capabilities to every Windows 10 computer. Its collection of prebuilt objects and stickers allows you to quickly bring 3D graphics, mockups, and designs to life. Join instructor and professional 3D artist George Maestri as he explores this new utility. Learn how to draw in 2D and 3D, add color and texture, clip objects from photos with the Magic Select tool, and transform 2D objects into 3D objects. Plus, learn how to download ready-made models from the Remix 3D library, and upload your own contributions. In the final chapter, George provides three real-world projects that showcase exactly what you can do with Paint 3D, including a greeting card, a tiny house model, and a 3D PowerPoint presentation.
