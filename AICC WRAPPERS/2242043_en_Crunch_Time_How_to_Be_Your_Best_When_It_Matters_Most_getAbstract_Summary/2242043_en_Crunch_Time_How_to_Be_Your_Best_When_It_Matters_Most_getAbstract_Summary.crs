[Course_Description]
Performance anxiety can be a formidable opponent, whether you’re a professional athlete, surgeon, salesperson, or student. How you deal with pressure during “crunch times” often determines if you are going to succeed or fail. Rick Peterson, a well-respected major league baseball pitching coach for many years, wrote a book on overcoming difficult, stress-filled situations. This audio-only summary from getAbstract reviews the highlights. Peterson’s philosophy, developed with leadership development expert Judd Hoekstra, uses “reframing,” the ability to look at a situation differently and avoid intimidation, and “chunking,” breaking daunting challenges down into smaller pieces. getAbstract believes that this practical, insightful guide can help you interpret events in a way that turns threats into challenges— and challenges into opportunities. This audiobook summary was created by getAbstract, the world’s largest provider of business book summaries. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
