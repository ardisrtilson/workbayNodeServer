[Course_Description]
In addition to all the tools and plug-ins that make Adobe XD a standout design tool, a key advantage of XD is its place in the Adobe Creative Cloud ecosystem. In this course, Bart Van de Wiele shows how you can leverage the strength of XD with other design tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Adobe Stock. He shows how to open and place native Illustrator and Photoshop content into Adobe XD, how to share and update content with Creative Cloud Libraries, and how to leverage Adobe Stock in your creative process. In addition to showing how to bring content into Adobe XD, Bart also shows how to export content out of XD and use it in other design applications.
