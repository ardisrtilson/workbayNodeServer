[Course_Description]
A diverse and fascinating array of factors influence even the simplest buying decisions. Understanding the driving forces behind why your customers buy from you—or opt for a competitor's product—can empower you to reach key consumers. In this course, join thought leader Michael Solomon as he takes a deep dive into the internal and external forces that influence consumer behavior. First, learn the importance of consumer behavior in helping us understand when, why, and how purchasing decisions are made. Michael shares how factors such as color, shape, and sound influence our perception of brands and products. He discusses gender identity and products geared towards different genders, as well as how consumer lifestyles, values, and attitudes affect product preferences. Michael also goes into external influences on consumer behavior, covering how groups make decisions and how ideas spread. Finally, Michael explores the role emotion plays in purchase decisions, and how you can structure messages to maximize persuasion.
