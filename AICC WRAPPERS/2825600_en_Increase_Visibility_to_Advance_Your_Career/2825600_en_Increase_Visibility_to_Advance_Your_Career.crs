[Course_Description]
Stellar performance is only half of the equation when it comes to professional success. The other half is visibilityâ€”ensuring that decision-makers know about your accomplishments and career goals. Many decisions that impact your career will happen when you're not even in the room. Company leaders are constantly setting strategy and direction, while determining who they want to play key roles in future projects. Even if you're a stellar performer, if the decision-makers aren't aware of your strengths and aspirations, you may get overlooked. In this course, Dr. Dawn Graham, career director for the Executive MBA Program at the Wharton School, explains how being strategic about visibility can be the key to opening the door to new opportunities. Learn how to incorporate practical strategies and tools that can help you get noticed by those who have the power to advance your career to the next level.
