[Course_Description]
Traditional feedback often fails because it assumes and prescribes. People let their pent-up emotions and judgments take control, and make no effort to understand the context behind problematic behavior. As a result, both parties end up feeling defensive and start to talk past one another. In this course, adapted from the podcast How to Be Awesome at Your Job, Jonathan Raymond shares how to let your curiosity guide conversations and communicate feedback that gets results. Jonathan goes over a simple five-step system to help you kick off a productive conversation about improvement without falling into the feedback trap. Along the way, he shares how to help people come to conclusions themselves and own the changes they make. This course was created by Pete Mockaitis of How to Be Awesome at Your Job. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
