[Course_Description]
You can get consistently better photos and video, if you understand your gear. This course helps photographers get up to speed quickly with the essential features and controls of Sony DSLRs—functionality shared by every model from the Alpha 6000 to the 7R II. It’s appropriate for new users and those transferring to Sony from other camera brands. Explore the shooting modes that go beyond auto, find out how to take photos and shoot 4K and HD video, and learn to adjust camera settings like ISO for specific situations, such as mixed lighting, fast movement, and low lighting levels. Instructor Rich Harrington also introduces the hardware and lens combinations that will help you achieve the best photos. Keep your camera close by while you watch to get the most from the course.
