When shooting travel or street photography in famous places, it's easy to end up with clich√©d pictures of tourist attractions. When you focus in a smaller area, just one neighborhood, you can get much better results. Valerie Jardin, photographer and host of the popular Street Focus podcast, takes us to the Fisherman's Wharf neighborhood in San Francisco to get some unexpected photographs of iconic spots. She shoots images of the bay and famous Powell Street cable cars, and takes street portraits of the locals. She also shares her recommendations for gear, and closes with a review of the day's best shots.
