The pace of life is constantly increasing, yet rather than improving our productivity, this increased speed often creates stress and causes us to make mistakes. Author Dave Crenshaw explores a handful of tactics designed to help you regain control of the pace of your work and life, allowing you to slow down and get more done. Dave offers the idea that operating at a more reasonable rate can make us more productive, relaxed, and creative.
