[Course_Description]
In his book The Art of Connection: 7 Relationship-Building Skills Every Leader Needs Now, leadership expert Michael J. Gelb explains that many great businesses base their success on face-to-face communication. The leaders of these companies depend on seven personal relationship skills, such as practicing humility and becoming a better listener, to increase the scope and the depth of their organizations. In this audio-only summary of his book, produced by getAbstract, Gelb presents a compelling case that learning these skills can help you connect more profoundly with other people and with yourself. getAbstract recommends Gelb’s advice to everyone seeking to build better relationships, especially those in customer-facing jobs or in human relations. This audiobook summary was created by getAbstract, the world’s largest provider of business book summaries. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
