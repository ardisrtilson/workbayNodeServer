[Course_Description]
Welcome to another hands-on Black-and-White Project. In this course, photographer and teacher Chris Orwig shows how to use HDR toning to craft a distinct look, starting with a raw black-and-white photograph. First, he shows how to perform basic adjustments in Camera Raw, and then moves into the HDR Toning controls in Photoshop. There he'll use sharpening, masking, and Curves to refine the portrait and blend the HDR layer back into the original image. And to prove HDR is not just a great look for portraits, Chris introduces several mini projects that show how to integrate the HDR toning effect into different photographs, such as landscapes and vintage-inspired pics.
