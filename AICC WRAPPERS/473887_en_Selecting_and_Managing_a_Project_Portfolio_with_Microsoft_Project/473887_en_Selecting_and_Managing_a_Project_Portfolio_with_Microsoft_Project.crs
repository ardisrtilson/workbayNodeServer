[Course_Description]
You may be familiar with Microsoft Project 2016 as a powerful project management tool that helps you plan and manage projects. In this course, expand the usefulness of this tool by taking a step back and leveraging it to cherry-pick projects for your portfolio. Follow along with project management expert Bonnie Biafore as she shares tips for selecting projects based on organizational goals and key project performance measures. Set up Project so that you can evaluate proposed projects and see which ones you should take on. Create custom fields to rate projects, use generic and named resources to compare demand with availability, and insert project schedules to determine when selected projects might fit into the pipeline. As a final step, build a report to help you review what's going on with your portfolio.
