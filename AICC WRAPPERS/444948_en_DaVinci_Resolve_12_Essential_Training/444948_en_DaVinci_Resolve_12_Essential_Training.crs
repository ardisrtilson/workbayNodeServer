[Course_Description]
For over a decade, DaVinci Resolve has been the go-to tool for colorists working on Hollywood films, commercials, and professional corporate video. Now it's available to anyone on a Mac or PC. The latest version, DaVinci Resolve 12, combines its high-end color grading tools with a full-featured nonlinear video-editing environment. You can edit, color correct, color grade, and render a video project without ever leaving the program. In these tutorials, professional colorist Patrick Inhofer guides viewers through the basics of using DaVinci Resolve 12. Get a look over Patrick's shoulder as he touches on key features in Resolve, while introducing the lingo every colorist needs to understand the program and the workflow. He shows how to import footage, keep it all organized, edit clips in the timeline, and start color grading your project: applying primary and secondary corrections, vignettes, looks, and Power Windows. He also shows how to target corrections with shapes and keys, match shots, and create hero shots to jump-start discussions with directors, clients, and colleagues. Most of the tutorials are compatible with both DaVinci Resolve and DaVinci Resolve Studio, the paid version of the software.
