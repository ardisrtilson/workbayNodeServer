[Course_Description]
In the majority of organizations, investment and prioritization decisions are not made on the basis of economic modeling. This inevitably leads to decision making using the HiPPO (the Highly Paid Person's Opinion) method. In this course, one of eight in the Lean Technology Strategy series, Jez Humble presents two frameworks—decision trees and cost of delay—that can be used to drive decisions at the portfolio, program, and product level. Jez then shows how to use these tools to expose and validate assumptions, and to constantly align your plans to the best economic choice. This course was created by Jez Humble. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
