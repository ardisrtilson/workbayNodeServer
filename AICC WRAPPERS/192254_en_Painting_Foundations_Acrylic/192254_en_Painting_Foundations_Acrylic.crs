[Course_Description]
Using acrylics is the simplest and most effective way for an absolute beginner to learn how to paint successfully. Acrylics can be used in thin layers like watercolors, or in thicker, more opaque applications of paint, like oil paint. Acrylics dry quickly and can be diluted and cleaned with water, making them simple to use, odorless, and accessible to all. In this course, Will Kemp takes you on a journey that will unleash your inner artist, providing an introduction to the materials and techniques used in acrylic painting. The course follows a progressive sequence, covering beginner and advanced acrylic painting methods, from underpainting and glazing to impasto and textural effects. It also addresses setup and materials, color mixing and pigment choice, brush-handling and palette-knife techniques, as well as gels and mediums. By the end of the course you'll have a final still-life project you can hang with pride, and a solid foundation of painting knowledge, making the transition into more challenging subjects or mediums much easier.
