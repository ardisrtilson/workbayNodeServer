[Course_Description]
In this course, author J. Scott Giaquinta showcases his techniques for electronic dance music production that he's used on productions and remixes with such artists as Madonna, Seal, David Bowie, Paul Oakenfold, and Johnny Cash. He'll focus on drum sounds, demonstrating his techniques for layering kick and snare samples, compressing the sounds, using drum loops, adding a human feel and groove, creating drum transitions, using FX and automation, and other drum mixing techniques. This course features Ableton Live and Native Instruments' Battery drum sampler, but you can use these techniques in any DAW of your choice.
