Learn how to write press releases: formal, official announcements regarding something new or significant about you or your business. Done correctly, press releases can promote your brand, distribute important information, and even improve your SEO. In this short writing course, PR expert Andrea Holland explains how to write an effective press release. She begins with a discussion of what press releases are and then walks you through finding your story, preparing to write, getting your headline and subhead down, crafting body copy, adding your boilerplate, and distributing the release through a newswire. Follow along using the handout Andrea has included with the courseâ€”a template she uses to kick-start the writing process for her own clients.
