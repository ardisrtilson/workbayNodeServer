[Course_Description]
Figma is a key UX toolâ€”for UX and interaction designers, of course, but also for business constituents who can use it to get up to speed, as well as developers who can use it to collect and hand off assets. In this course, instructor Brian Wood shows you how to share comments, designs, technical assets, and more with your Figma project. Brian explains how to invite others to join your project, follow along in observation mode, and add, view, and manage comments. He goes over how to export assets, share prototypes, share your work with developers, and more. Brian also covers how to create a team in Figma and how to create and use a team library.
