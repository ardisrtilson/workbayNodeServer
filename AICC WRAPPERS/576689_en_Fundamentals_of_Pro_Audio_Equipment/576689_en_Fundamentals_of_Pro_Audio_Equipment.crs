[Course_Description]
Modern audio engineers and producers have access to a wealth of cool equipment that simplifies their workflow and enhances their final mixes. While it's possible to get by without a deep understanding of this technology, all creative pros can benefit from learning how the gear they use in the studio actually works. In this course, instructor Greg Wurth explains the inner workings of some of the most influential pieces of pro audio equipment. Throughout the course, Greg shares images, diagrams, and audio examples that can help you grasp how this equipment functions, and why you might want to opt for one piece over another. Greg dives into working with different kinds of microphones and preamps, describes the main types of compressors and equalizers, and shows how an analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converter works. Plus, he covers analog summing—the process of combining multiple audio channels down to a stereo signal—and analog emulation.
