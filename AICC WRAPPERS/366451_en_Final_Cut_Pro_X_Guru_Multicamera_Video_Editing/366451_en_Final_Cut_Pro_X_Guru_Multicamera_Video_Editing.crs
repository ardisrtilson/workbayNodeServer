Luckily, Final Cut Pro X supports multicamera editing and offers a variety of tools, shortcuts, and workspaces for different modern-day shooting techniques. Its multicamera, or multicam, editing process is similar to live switching that occurs in mobile studios and newsrooms and helps speed up the post-processing workflow. So join Nick Harauz in this course as he covers organizing media, creating multicam clips for interview and music video-style projects, and working with the specialized multicam options in Final Cut Pro X. With these tips and tricks, you'll be able to pull together your multicam footage into dynamic videos that maximize the impact of every shot.
