Charts allow you to communicate information visually, in a way that's more impactful than raw data, and they happen to be one of the most powerful and easy-to-use features in Microsoft Excel. In Excel 2016, there are six brand-new chart types to learn. Let Dennis Taylor show you how to create different kinds of Excel charts, from column, bar, and line charts to exploded pies, and decide which type works best for your data. Learn how to fine-tune your chart's color and style; add titles, labels, and legends; insert shapes, pictures, and text boxes; and pull data from multiple sources. Plus, get an overview of the new chart types in Excel 2016: Treemap, Sunburst, Waterfall, Histogram, Pareto, and Box & Whisker. The training wraps up with lesson on changing data sources for charts and printing and sharing charts.
