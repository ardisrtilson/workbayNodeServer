[Course_Description]
This installment of Photoshop CC for Photographers goes beyond the basics and focuses on the features and techniques that will dramatically improve your photographs and maximize your efficiency. Photographer and teacher Chris Orwig first illustrates the strengths of Bridge, the Adobe Photoshop companion program, as an organizational tool and a device for batch processing photographs. He then moves on to mastering Photoshop, starting with layers—targeting, moving, and merging them with greater speed and efficiency. Then learn how to make better selections, refine their edges, and paint in adjustments, as well as increase the color accuracy of your images with Levels and Curves. Plus, learn to work with blending modes, apply creative color effects, and use the Burn and Dodge tools to improve contrast—a classic photographic technique updated for the digital age. Chris also covers correcting perspective and distortion, creating photo composites and panoramas, and working with DSLR video in Photoshop.
