[Course_Description]
The best teams don't wait for someone to tell them what to do. Instead, they work together to set themselves up for success. In this course, learn how teams can collaborate more effectively. Discover how to ask key questions, clarify expectations, and ensure everyone is kept in sync. Find out how a team can refine its purpose, use one another’s preferred communication modes, and solicit and incorporate feedback, helping members collaborate proactively—with or without managerial oversight. Join corporate trainer and author Dana Brownlee as she shares clear and proven collaboration strategies, specific activities, and techniques you can use to minimize miscommunications and avoid common collaboration mishaps.
