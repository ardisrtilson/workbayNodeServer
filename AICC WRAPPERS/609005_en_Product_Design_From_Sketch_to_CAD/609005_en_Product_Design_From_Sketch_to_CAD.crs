[Course_Description]
When you begin product designs with sketches, you need a repeatable strategy for moving them into CAD. This course takes your concept sketch through a workflow that begins in Adobe Photoshop, moves to Rhino for revision, and ends in Illustrator, where you finalize your model and prepare it for presentation. Each step maximizes the unique powers of each app: sketching and painting in Photoshop, modeling curves in Rhino, and coloring and labeling in Illustrator. Designer Jean Gorospe's tips help you retain the creativity and flexibility of sketching while taking advantage of everything CAD tools have to offer.
