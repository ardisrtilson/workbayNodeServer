[Course_Description]
The one trait many successful leaders share is their natural curiosity and desire to learn. We are all innately curiousâ€”so why is it that some people seem to discover more answers and lead a more empowering life than others? Put simply, they tend to think critically and ask the right questions. In this course, learn how to leverage the power of questions to move your team, leadership, and career to the next level. Join Joshua Miller as he spells out the benefits of getting curious and shares how to empower yourself through questions. Discover social media's role in asking questions, why certain types of questions can lead to dead ends, how to effectively answer questions that are directed at you, and more. So much is missed by not raising your hand, your voice, or your platform. Upon completing this course, you'll have a better understanding of how to use questions to seize opportunities and open doors.
