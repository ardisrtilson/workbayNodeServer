An authentic brand is a powerful brand. It knows who its audience is, what they want, and how to reliably deliver it. When branding doesn’t have to try hard or fake anything, its sincerity can rise above the clamor. In this course, learn how to develop, maintain, and evolve an authentic brand. Instructor Justin Ahrens explores the research and processes that go into finding your brand's focus. He goes over the building blocks of a successful brand—one that can not only deliver on its promises, but also live its values. Plus, learn about identifying your brand's personality, what authenticity means to your customers, and the power of consistency and truth.
