[Course_Description]
A course on interactive book design for the iPad, a topic that wouldn't have existed two years ago, is now being taught by Stacey Williams-Ng at the Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design. Even Stacey seems surprised that her love of illustration and knowledge of graphic design have combined into a new career for her, interactive storytelling. She loves putting brush to canvas, which is how her children's books begin before they're photographed or scanned into the iPadâ€”where she actually uses an app to create apps. Her business has blossomed into a publishing company (Little Bahalia) that's dedicated to creating interactive children's literature. We join her at her home studio in Milwaukee where she's animating her latest book, A Troop Is a Group of Monkeys, destined for the iPad. Quick quiz: What is a group of bats called? Find out during this installment of the lynda.com documentary series The Creative Spark.
