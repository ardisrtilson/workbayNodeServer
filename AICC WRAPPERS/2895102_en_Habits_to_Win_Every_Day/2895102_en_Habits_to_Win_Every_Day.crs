Do you want to find ways to build more alignment, manage your energy more effectively, and increase your motivation levels? In this course, executive coach and psychologist Dr. Jason Richardson empowers you to do all these things and more. Jason first walks through how you can shift your mindset to create an environment that feeds your success. He helps you identify what's important to you, and shares how to pinpoint the goals you're looking to achieve. Then, he reviews how you can reduce your energy killers and swap them out for other sources that can actually give you more energy. Jason also provides methods for how you can commit to achieving the goals you've set out to accomplish by building in consistency, finding your why, and keep yourself motivated. Finally, Jason reviews how you can keep yourself motivated as you look to accomplish and achieve new things. After finishing this course, youâ€™ll be prepared to incorporate these habits, shift your mindset, and win every day. This course was created by Madecraft.
