[Course_Description]
Discover tactics, tricks, and workarounds that can make working in After Effects easier and more fun. Owen Lowery introduces various free scripts that you can install for better functionality and faster workflow, discusses animation and design theory, and shows simple, effective ways to put that theory into practice. He guides you through several solutions to the kinds of common problems that new After Effects users tend to run into. Plus—as this course doesn't build from lesson to lesson—you can dive into whichever topic piques your interest.
