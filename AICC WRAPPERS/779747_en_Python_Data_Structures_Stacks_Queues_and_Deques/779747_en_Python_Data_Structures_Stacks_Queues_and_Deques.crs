[Course_Description]
Data structures like stacks and queues come up frequently in interviews for technical roles. Though many candidates may never encounter data structures in day-to-day programming, showing a mastery of these concepts can help you rock your next interviewâ€”and add to your coding toolkit. In this course, Erin Allard shows how to use Python to build the top three linear data structures: stacks, queues, and deques. She compares and contrasts the data structures and shows how to implement them in an object-oriented way in Python. Learn how to define each class and use Python's built-in methods to accomplish the necessary behaviors, such as push, pop, and peek; enqueue and dequeue; and add_front and remove_rear. Challenges in each chapter help practice your new skills and prepare for your next interview.
