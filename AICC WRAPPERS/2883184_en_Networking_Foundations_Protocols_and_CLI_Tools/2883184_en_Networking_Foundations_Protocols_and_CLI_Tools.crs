[Course_Description]
Protocols are the lifeblood of network communications. Every website, email, and electronic bank transaction depends on them. One of the core responsibilities for any IT and networking professional is troubleshooting network connections. This course introduces the main methods for troubleshooting network connectivity issues using different protocols and command-line (CLI) tools. Networking expert Greg Sowell covers HTTP and HTTPS, the protocols that deliver websites; shows how domain names are resolved via DNS; and explains how voice traffic is carried over a network with VoIP. Greg shows how to examine all these connections and their traffic using CLI tools such as ipconfig, ping, ARP, and Telnet. By the end of this course, you'll be better prepared to troubleshoot any network connection and keep the communication flowing.
