[Course_Description]
Being able to do more with less is a highly valued skill in any organization, and not just in down times. In this course, Dr. Todd Dewett helps you assess your resourcefulness by first evaluating your professional resources (personal network, expertise, information, and access to finances) and explains how to decide when and how to use them. He also provides advice on developing habits to cultivate resourcefulness, such as asking the right questions and building your network across a broad spectrum.
