[Course_Description]
Explore the fundamentals of shooting great-looking video with an iPhone. Mobile devices have transformed video production, making it possible to capture new angles and perspectives without a large crew or lots of additional equipment. Instructor Nick Harauz shows how to shoot talking heads and support material like B-roll, and capture slow-motion and time-lapse footage. He explains how to keep shots organized, on and off the set, and walks through a post-production workflow for editing videos either directly on the iPhone or on a computer. He also introduces a variety of iPhone apps that can create effects like hyperlapse and the golden hour look. Finally, Nick shows how to upload completed videos for sharing on YouTube or Instagram.
