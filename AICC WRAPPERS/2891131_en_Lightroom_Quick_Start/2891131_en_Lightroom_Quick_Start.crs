[Course_Description]
Get started with Adobe Lightroom over your lunch break. In this course, digital graphics expert Jesús Ramirez introduces you to how Lightroom works through a series of basic projects. Jesús starts with importing photos into Lightroom. He shows you how to adjust light, exposure, contrast, highlights, and shadows. Jesús describes how to improve your photo by removing a color cast, adjusting the vibrance and saturation, making your images pop with texture and clarity, applying a vignette, and more. He covers sharpening, noise reduction, lens correction, and straightening photos, then goes into targeted adjustments, gradients, and the Healing Brush. Finally, learn how to export and voila! You now have a fantastic image to use for your project.
