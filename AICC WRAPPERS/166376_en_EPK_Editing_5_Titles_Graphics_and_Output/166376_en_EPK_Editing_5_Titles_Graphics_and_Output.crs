[Course_Description]
Once your EPK is edited, visually enhanced, and has a complete audio mix, it's time to add the titles and graphics and output the final video. This installment of EPK Editing Workflows shows you how to choose a look and then quickly create the text and graphics with Adobe Premiere Pro and Photoshop. You'll learn some simple but smart tricks for blending your footage with your newly created content, and tips for making sure your levels are still legal for broadcast. Finally, you'll discover how to output your finished media using the Adobe Media Encoder. These tutorials will help you achieve a consistent, recognizable style for your titles and graphicsâ€”one that's similar to the original subject matter but distinct enough to let viewers know they're watching something different.
