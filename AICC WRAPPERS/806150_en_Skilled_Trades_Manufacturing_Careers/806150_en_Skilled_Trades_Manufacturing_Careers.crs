[Course_Description]
Many of the objects that make up our world—from the coffee mugs in our cupboards to the laptops on our desks—were transformed into finished products via the wonders of modern manufacturing. But while the manufacturing industry is seen as a critical part of society, many folks still associate manufacturing jobs with tedious assembly-line labor. In reality, today’s advanced manufacturing roles boast higher-than-average pay rates, a longer job tenure than most, and one of the highest percentage of workers eligible for health benefits. In this course, Kipp Bradford acquaints job seekers with opportunities in the manufacturing trades, explaining what these jobs look like, which challenges and opportunities they present, and how to jump-start a career in this growing field.
