[Course_Description]
If your WordPress workflow is streamlined from the start, development is simpler, more organized, and more efficientâ€”all the way through to publication. This course takes your WordPress knowledge to the next level by covering three common WordPress workflows. First, learn a time-tested workflow for building a WordPress site: from choosing a host to launching a site. Next, discover how to build a child theme. Finally, review the tools and techniques professionals use to develop sites for clients, including setting up a staging environment and version control. Developer and WordPress educator Joe Casabona concludes with a look at some advanced tools you might want to put into your workflows, including automated testing and static site tools.
