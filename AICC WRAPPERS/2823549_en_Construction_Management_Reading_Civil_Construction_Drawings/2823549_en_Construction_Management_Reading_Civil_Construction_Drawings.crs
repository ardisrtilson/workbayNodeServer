[Course_Description]
Construction personnel of all types need to understand the role that civil construction drawings, or blueprints, play in the construction process. In this course, Jim Rogers explains why civil construction drawings matter and discusses how to use them on construction projects and job sites. Jim digs into the common features of civil construction drawings, going over standard details, project specifications, how to find the scale information of each drawing, and how to measure dimensions on construction drawings. He then shows how to decipher different types of civil construction drawings, including site and plot plans that describe how to locate structures on a property; grading and drainage plans that capture existing ground conditions and help determine the extent of the construction work to be completed; street improvement plans; and more.
