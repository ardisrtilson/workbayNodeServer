Picking a great team of professionals is one of the most important and impactful decisions you are going to make in your music career. Steve Rennie knows music professionals; he has over 35 years in the music business. His series, An Insider's Guide to Today's Music Biz, teaches the ins and outs of the music business to bands, managers, and songwriters. In this installment, you'll learn about the key players you need on your team and what they do, how much they get paid, how you find them, and when you need them. It starts with perhaps the most important member of your team, the manager. Steve also explains the role of lawyers, agents, business managers, publicists, and the digital team in charge of PR, social media, and other online distribution and promotion strategies.
