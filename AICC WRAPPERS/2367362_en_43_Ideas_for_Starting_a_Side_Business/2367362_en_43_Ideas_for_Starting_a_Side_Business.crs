It's a great time to explore creating a side business that can earn you extra income. In this course, Dana Robinson, a serial entrepreneur and attorney, shares 43 ideas for making additional income. Dana offers an array of options, including being a voice artist, turning trash into treasure (and selling it for a profit), landing copyediting gigs, becoming a virtual assistant, and working in real estate management. Dana highlights the value of each opportunity, outlines how to get started, and provides examples of successful ventures. After watching this course, you'll be ready to put one of these ideas into action. This course was created by Madecraft. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
