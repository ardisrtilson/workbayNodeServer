[Course_Description]
Databases are critical to most line-of-business applications; they need to be tightly managed to perform well in a DevOps environment. This course targets developers and database admins who write code and work with SQL Server databases. Instructor Brian Randall shows how to put a database under version control and move through an automated release pipeline using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Azure. Learn how to build a SQL database using a continuous integration workflow, release the database via continuous deployment, and bake in quality from the beginning, by testing the database with a number of different tools. Plus, learn how to troubleshoot over a dozen real-world issues that admins encounter with SQL databases, from database drift to multi-environment deploys.
