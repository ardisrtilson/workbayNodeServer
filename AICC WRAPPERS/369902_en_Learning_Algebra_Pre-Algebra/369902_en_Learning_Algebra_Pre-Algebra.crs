[Course_Description]
Pre-algebra is the first step in high school math, forming the building blocks that lead to geometry, trigonometry, and calculus. This course will help you master the basics: from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to new types of numbers (integers and negative numbers) and concepts such as the order of operations and distribution. This course includes practice challenges and worksheets, as well as tips for educators who are helping students master pre-algebra for Common Core. Karin Hutchinson also helps you evaluate, write, and simplify expressions, and solve word problems and complex algebraic expressions.
