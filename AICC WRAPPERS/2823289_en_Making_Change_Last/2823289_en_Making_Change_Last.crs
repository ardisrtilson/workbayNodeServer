[Course_Description]
It's common for individuals to take a course, attend a seminar, or read a book and feel inspired to make a change. Unfortunately, it's also common for people to avoid taking actionâ€”or for that change to last less than a month. This course identifies the reason why this happens and provides specific steps you can take to not only overcome this issue, but also create a pattern for continual, long-lasting change. Productivity expert Dave Crenshaw shares strategies for focusing on realistic short-term progress in order to make changes that stick. Dave also provides tips for finding a person to keep you accountable, measuring your growth, crafting a long-term plan for progress, and more. Note: This course was created by Dave Crenshaw and Invaluable Inc. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
