[Course_Description]
Bestselling author and sales coach Lisa Earle McLeod has helped companies like Google and Roche build passionate, purpose-driven sales organizations. In this course, sales professionals can learn how to negotiate with the best interests of their organization and their customers at heart, by uncovering their own noble purpose. Lisa reveals the surprising truth behind why compromise doesn't work; instead, she explains how to ask questions that reveal information about the buyerâ€”and help you decide when you can negotiate and when you can't. She also identifies common negotiation traps and ways to negotiate that don't just close the sale today, but build longer-term relationships for tomorrow.
