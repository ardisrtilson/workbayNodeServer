[Course_Description]
Why is compassion so powerful? Like many forms of spirituality and meditation, compassion practice has been shown by research to enhance your health, psychological well-being, relationships, and sense of purpose. In The Science of Compassion: Getting Started, health psychologist Kelly McGonigal lays out what to expect in the audio-only The Science of Compassion series. She presents a practical workshop to help you understand what makes compassion work, and how you can cultivate it in your life. Kelly examines the many benefits of compassion, not just to those who receive it, but also to those who give it, and to all who witness the act of compassion in action. Over the course of this series, she provides tools and guidance for overcoming emotional fatigue, empathic distress, self-judgment, and other obstacles that can keep you closed down and afraid to reach out.
