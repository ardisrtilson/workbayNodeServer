Get ready for the Microsoft Office Specialist Outlook 2010 certification exam. Microsoft Master Instructor Megan Hoffman helps test-takers prepare for exam 77-884, which covers the four main skill sets in Outlook 2010: customizing the Outlook interface and managing messages, calendars, and contacts. The course first explores the MOS certification program and highlights its cost, format, and objectives. Megan then explains how to manage the Outlook environment by customizing the interface, printing and saving information, and searching in Outlook. Next, learn how to manage email messages (including creating, formatting, and organizing messages), create contacts, and manage calendars (including appointments, meetings, and events). Finally, find out how to work with notes, tasks, and journal entries. Challenge exercises are included along the way, and the course concludes with a full-length practice exam.
