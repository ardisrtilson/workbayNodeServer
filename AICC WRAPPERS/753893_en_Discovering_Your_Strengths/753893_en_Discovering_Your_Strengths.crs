[Course_Description]
Understanding what you do best is essential to succeeding professionally. But often we are unclear on our own strengths. Join leadership expert Dave Crenshaw on a journey of self-discovery, as he walks you through a simple framework to identify your strengths. Discover your natural gifts, your passions, your skills, and your greatest abilities. Dave shares specific exercises to help you pinpoint what you should focus on doing (and what you should avoid) to develop your strengths and increase your value as an employee. The exercises can also help you clarify if your current job is a fit and what you can do to address a mismatch.
