In this course, Chris Orwig shares techniques that can help you use Photoshop to bring out the best in your portrait subjects in a pinch. He explains how to remove distractions from the background of an image, as well as unwanted logos, jewelry, and even lint. He also shows how to shape and sculpt your portrait subjects, improve skin, eyes, teeth, and hair, and use multiple frames.
