[Course_Description]
Silicon Valley has always attracted talented designers looking to improve user experience. But designers can improve the human experience too. Social innovation is the process of developing and deploying effective solutions to challenging and often systemic social and environmental issues. This course is for those who want to use social innovation and design thinking to achieve big results for their communities. Get ready to discover design opportunities to reimagine human behavior. Find out to break down impenetrable and unpredictable problems using concepts like the iceberg model and nested systems. Then find out how design can serve the higher purposes of inclusivity and social justice. Instructor and sustainable design expert Scott Boylston explains the relationship between design thinking and social innovation and teaches us about the impact design can have on global goals, including sustainable development, anti-racism, and equality.
