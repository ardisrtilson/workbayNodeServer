Discover how to use Adobe Animate—the multimedia drawing, layout, animation, and interactive design application—to create rich, expressive animations and interactive content. Instructor Joseph Labrecque covers what you need to know to get up and running with this powerful application, discussing how to create a basic Animate project, work with ready-to-use assets, and share your work. He also covers how to animate original content, including how to improve the look of your assets using color management tools and bring your assets to life using shape, classic, and motion tweens. Plus, learn how to take your animations to the next level by incorporating sound and adding common interactions.
