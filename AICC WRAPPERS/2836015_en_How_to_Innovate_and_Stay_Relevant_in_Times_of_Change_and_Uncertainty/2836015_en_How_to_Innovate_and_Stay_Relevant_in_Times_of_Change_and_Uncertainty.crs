[Course_Description]
Times of change and uncertainty are great opportunities to benefit from innovation. When every other company seems to be doing the same thing and cutting activities deemed to be unnecessary, you can benefit by doing the exact opposite. Join innovation expert and author Dave Birss, as he teaches leaders and managers how to spot new opportunities, pivot, and innovate when the world around them has gone mad. Discover how to set the groundwork for innovation, encourage your teams to generate innovative ideas, and select the best ideas to prototype and launch into action. This course was created by Dave Birss. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
