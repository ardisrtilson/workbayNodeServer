[Course_Description]
With Adobe's mobile apps, you can enhance and composite photos—including the ones you snap on your iPhone or iPad—and quickly create compelling images and illustrations on the go. With the Creative Cloud, and a tap on an icon, you can send those graphics to Photoshop (and other CC desktop tools or your CC Libraries) for further refinement. This combination provides a complete mobile-to-desktop workflow for today's busy designer. In this course, Tony Harmer shows how to bring photographic elements together into engaging photo illustrations with Adobe apps. He uses Photoshop Sketch to work out ideas, enhances images with Photoshop Fix, combines graphics with Photoshop Mix, and then refines the composite in Photoshop. The end result is a polished composite illustration ready for publishing or sharing with clients.
