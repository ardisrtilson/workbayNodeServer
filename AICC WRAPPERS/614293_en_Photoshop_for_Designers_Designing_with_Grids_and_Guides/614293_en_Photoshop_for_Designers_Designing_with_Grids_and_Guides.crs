[Course_Description]
Designing with grids is an essential part of any designer's skill set. Guides, grids, and their related tools bring structure and consistency to designs. By suggesting visual relationships, they can also speed workflow and inspire the artwork itself. In this course, designer Nigel French introduces the fundamentals of guides and grids in Photoshop, showing how these tools can improve the way you use the application. Explore how to create, precisely position, delete, and show and hide guides. Learn about the different types of grids, and the intelligent features such as Smart Guides, snapping, the GuideGuide plugin, and the New Guide Layout tool. Discover how to set up your own modular layout grid, and then explore the different types of crop overlay grids, from the Rule of Thirds to the Golden Spiral.
