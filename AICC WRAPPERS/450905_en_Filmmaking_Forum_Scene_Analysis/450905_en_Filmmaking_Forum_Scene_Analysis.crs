[Course_Description]
Analyzing a scene helps new and seasoned filmmakers alike understand the creative and technical decisions of directors and editors. This course provides a rare opportunity to get inside the minds of video storytellers to discuss the filmmaking processâ€”and appreciate how they arrived at the finished product. Ashley Kennedy offers new scenes for discussion. Then she interviews the filmmakers about their work: their aesthetic, approach, workflow, and collaboration style. Hear from film professionals such as independent filmmaker and editor Kurt Kuenne (Dear Zachary), TV editor and documentary director Zack Arnold (Empire and Go Far: The Christopher Rush Story), feature film editor Sofi Marshall (A Teacher), professor and filmmaker Sam Kauffmann (Massacre at Murambi), and more. Get behind-the-scenes details and firsthand looks at what really happens during the course of filmmaking, in this forum.
