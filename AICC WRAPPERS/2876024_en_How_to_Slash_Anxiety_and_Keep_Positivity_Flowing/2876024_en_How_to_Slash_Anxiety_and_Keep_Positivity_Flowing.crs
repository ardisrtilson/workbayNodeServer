[Course_Description]
Don’t underestimate the impact of self-care on your productivity and well-being. Self-care is a requirement for resilience. Overcoming obstacles while you’re feeling low only makes things harder than they should be. In this course, adapted from the podcast How to Be Awesome at Your Job, Anne Grady teaches methods to manage anxiety, build resilience, and stay positive. Anne goes over the parts of the brain and how they are impacted by mindfulness. She also takes a look at negativity bias, explaining why this powerful survival tool can deeply color your experience and memories. Plus, Anne provides a few helpful tips to help you get your brain back online after a stressful event, discusses how mindfulness training puts you in control of your focus, and more. This course was created by Pete Mockaitis of How to Be Awesome at Your Job. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
