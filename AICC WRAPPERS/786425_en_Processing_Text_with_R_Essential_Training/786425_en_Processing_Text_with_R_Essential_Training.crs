Todayâ€™s big data and analytics pipelines are consuming more and more text data generated through websites, social media, and private communications. But deriving insights from text isn't straightforward; it requires a series of techniques and forms for preparing text for analytics and machine learning. In this course, learn the essential techniques for cleansing and processing text in R, and discover how to convert text to a form that's ready for analytics and predictions.
