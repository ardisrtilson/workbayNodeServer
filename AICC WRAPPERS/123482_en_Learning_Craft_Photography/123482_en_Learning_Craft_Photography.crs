The ever-increasing popularity of handmade crafts has spawned thousands of blogs, forums, events, websites, and digital tools. With so much competition out there, the best way to catch a viewer's attention is with an incredible photograph of your incredible craft. In this one-of-a-kind workshop, professional craft blogger and photographer Megan Andersen, aka Radmegan, takes you step-by-step through the basics of craft photography, starting with how a camera and its settings work. She shares composition techniques to make craft photos more compelling, image-editing tips that don't require expensive software, and some great resources for getting craft images blogged about, printed, and seen by the masses. Along the way, learn a little crafting by making three different kinds of affordable at-home and mobile photo studios. Whether you are taking photos of handmade crafts to sell, looking for tips on product photography, have a blog and want your images to get noticed, or just want to improve the quality of photos you plan on sharing with friends and family, this workshop can help you produce great images.
