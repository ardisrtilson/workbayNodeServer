[Course_Description]
Sketch makes vector design easyâ€”especially for UX designers who aren't natural illustrators. Dive into Sketch for Mac and learn how to wrangle vector linework, fills and effects, and Bezier curves like a pro. Discover how to edit the different types of Bezier points and curves, and create simple and complex shapes with ease using the Boolean operations. Learn to recreate imagery in vector form, and use layers and symbols to simplify your vector art. Author John-Paul Ballard also shows how to export artwork from Sketch in a variety of formats, including JPG, PDF, and SVG. Challenges issued along the way help you practice creating common UX interface elements, such as toolbars and navigation icons.
