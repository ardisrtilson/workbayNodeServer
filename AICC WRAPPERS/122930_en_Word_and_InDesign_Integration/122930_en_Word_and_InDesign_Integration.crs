[Course_Description]
Many designers use Microsoft Word and Adobe InDesign together, but the unique formatting and hidden markup in Word often cause issues when you bring text into InDesign. In this course, learn how to make these programs play nicely together and create beautifully formatted documents from existing text. Author and InDesign Secrets creator Anne-Marie Concepción shows how to clean up your text formatting, strip out Word styles and map them to InDesign, place Word document elements in InDesign, and fix the formatting once the text arrives. Plus, learn to repair corrupt Word files, and explore alternatives to Word such as InCopy and Google Docs.
