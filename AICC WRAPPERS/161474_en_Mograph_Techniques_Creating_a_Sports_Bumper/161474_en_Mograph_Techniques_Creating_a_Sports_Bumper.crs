[Course_Description]
How do motion graphics artists create those polished animated graphics for channels like ESPN on such short deadlines? They turn to the high-powered toolset in CINEMA 4D. In this course, EJ Hassenfratz shows you how to use those same tools to create your own dynamic, high-energy sports bumper. Learn how to model the basic elements in C4D and add robotic-style movement with the Mograph module, and take a logo from Adobe Illustrator and turn it into a smart, beveled 3D project. Then EJ shows how to combine it all in After Effects, along with a few special effects. This workflow mimics a real post-production environment and allows a more intermediate look at the mograph module and an opportunity to take your motion graphics knowledge to the next level.
