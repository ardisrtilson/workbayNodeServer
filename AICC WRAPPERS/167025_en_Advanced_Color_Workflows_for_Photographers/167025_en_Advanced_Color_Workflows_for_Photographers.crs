[Course_Description]
In photography, a color-managed workflow makes it easier to obtain consistent-looking color in every phase of the process: when you're editing photos on screen, printing them on an inkjet printer, or having them printed by a commercial lab. In this course, Joe Brady builds on his Color Management Fundamentals course, focusing on color-management issues of specific interest to photographers. After a review of digital-color concepts, the course explores creating color profiles for each device in the digital photography workflow, from monitor to printer, to camera. Joe demonstrates the tools and techniques behind color profiling, even covering tabletsâ€”ideal for photographers using iPads or Android tablets as wireless remote controls.
