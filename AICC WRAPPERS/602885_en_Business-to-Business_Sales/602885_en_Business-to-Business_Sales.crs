[Course_Description]
Business to business (B2B) sales are often more complex than business to consumer (B2C) sales. There is more competition at the B2B level, and more stakeholders. Salespeople are trying to sell to experienced buyers, who want the best product at the best price. However, with the right techniques, B2B can be the place where salespeople shine. Learn exactly what it takes to be successful at business to business salesâ€”whether you're moving from a B2C role or just starting your career in sales. Join Robbie Baxter, as she reviews over a typical day in B2B sales, from meeting with prospects to closing the deal. She provides insights into the skillset and personality of a successful salesperson, and tips for finding a B2B sales position. For sales managers and leaders, Robbie also provides some tips for building out B2B sales goals, structuring a sales team, and collaborating with the rest of the organization for ongoing success.
