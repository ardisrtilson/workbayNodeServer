[Course_Description]
High-performance organizations continuously move initiatives through the business model life cycle. They understand that using the same strategy across the entire portfolio will result in negative outcomes and results. To be successful, a company should have a balanced portfolio of products that reflect the mission, strategy, and desired state the organization wishes to be in. In this course, one of eight in the Lean Technology Strategy series, Barry O'Reilly shares how to seek out new business models, products, and services to ensure the future business relevance, growth, and evolution of your organization. Explore the life cycle of innovation, strategies for innovation, and methods for measuring your success. This course was created by Barry O'Reilly. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
