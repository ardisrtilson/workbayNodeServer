Make your copy of Premiere Pro your very own. Learn how to rearrange its windows to suit your editing style with a custom workspace. Professional editors harness workspaces to take advantage of Premiere Pro's strengths and flexibilities; you can also use them to improve the quality and speed of your editing workflow. So join Jason Osder as he introduces the concept of workspaces, explores the default workspaces that ship with Premiere, and shows how to create custom workspaces that meet your editing needs.
