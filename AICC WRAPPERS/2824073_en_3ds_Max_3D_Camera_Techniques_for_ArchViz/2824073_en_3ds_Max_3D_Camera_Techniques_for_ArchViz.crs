[Course_Description]
Every building tells a story. Adding a little motion helps it come to life. This course shows how to use cinematic camera techniques in 3ds Max to showcase your architectural projects. George Maestri demonstrates how to set up compelling camera angles and movement that will show 3D architectural renderings in their best light. Learn how to create, place, aim, and move cameras; animate cameras along a path; fine-tune motion; and export images and animatics that tell a compelling story about your design.
