Business supply chains are becoming more complex and reliant on technology. This opens them to unique cyber risksâ€”and increased regulatory requirements. Explore the challenges, considerations, and potential conflicts of interest businesses face as they begin to address cybersecurity in the supply chain. Dr. Emma Osborn discusses how supply chains are evolving, and the different ways that businesses within the supply chain interact. She reviews examples of real-world supply chains and uses these to explore how the scope of cybersecurity risk is creeping past traditional organizational boundaries. You can then learn some approaches for managing relationships and improving supply chain security, discovering what works best for each scenario.
