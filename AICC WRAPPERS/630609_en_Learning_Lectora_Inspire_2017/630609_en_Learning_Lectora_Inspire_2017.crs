Start creating stunning, interactive, and responsive elearning courses with Lectora Inspire. In this course, instructor David Rivers shows you how to get up and running with Lectora Inspire, the suite of rapid elearning authoring tools. Learn how to set up a new title by designing it from scratch, using the wizards, or importing a PowerPoint presentation. Then learn how to add text, tables, graphics, and video; apply new page layouts and themes; use effects; add branching and interactivity with actions; and build quizzes and surveys. Finally, discover how to publish your title so it can be viewed on the web, or in a SCORM-, AICC-, or xAPI-compliant format for learning management systems.
