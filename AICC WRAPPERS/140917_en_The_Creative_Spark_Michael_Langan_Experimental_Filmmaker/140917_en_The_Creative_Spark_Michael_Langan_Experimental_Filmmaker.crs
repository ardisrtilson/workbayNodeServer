[Course_Description]
Michael Langan makes short films that blend animation and live action, inspired by motion picture pioneers like Eadweard Muybridge and Norman McLaren, but they're nothing like you've ever seen. It's his uncompromising vision that has companies like Pepsi and Samsung soliciting him for commercialsâ€”giving him creative control that other directors can only dream about. Langan's newest passion, screenwriting for feature-length films, lets him bring the things he loves about experimental shorts to a wider audience. In this Creative Spark, we profile Michael as he looks back on the evolution of his style, and reflects on his future in film. Watch the bonus feature for a full-length version of Choros, Langan's 2011 collaboration with dancer Terah Maher.
