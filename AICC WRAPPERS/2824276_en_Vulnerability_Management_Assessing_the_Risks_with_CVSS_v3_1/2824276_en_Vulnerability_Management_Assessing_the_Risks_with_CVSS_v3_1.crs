[Course_Description]
Vulnerability management can be difficult, and understanding the risks that vulnerabilities pose in your own environment is key to determining how (and in what order) to tackle them. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) was developed to address this. In this course, explore the essential metrics in the CVSS methodology, as well as how to apply CVSS scores to assess risk and determine what to fix first. Instructor Lora Vaughn takes a deep dive into CVSS version 3.1, examining the characteristics it measures, the scoring formula, and how to apply CVSS scores to your environment. Using practical examples, she covers the three most essential aspects of CVSS: Base, Temporal, and Environmental metrics. Upon wrapping up this course, you'll be equipped with the essential knowledge you need to use CVSS scores to prioritize remediation efforts.
