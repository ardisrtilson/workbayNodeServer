[Course_Description]
Almost everything you do in the workplace is a project, from the smallest task to the largest endeavor. All of this work can benefit from some basic project management skills. Once mastered, you will be able to transfer this valuable skillset to any project, of any size, in any industry. In this course, management trainer Chris Croft outlines the twelve steps to managing projects without creating a lot of extra overhead, and shows how to use traditional project management tools—such as Gantt charts and network diagrams—to help you succeed. Learn how to plan a project, manage resources, monitor progress, and deliver your project on time and on budget.
