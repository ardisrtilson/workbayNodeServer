[Course_Description]
With Windows 10 IoT Core, Microsoft brings together Windows and the Internet of Things (IoT). This version of Windows 10 is optimized for smaller devices, runs on the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3, and allows you to incorporate the power of Windows into nearly any kind of device you can dream upâ€”from smart watches to car data connectors. This course is the first in a series of two courses by Michael Lehman; both courses are designed to help you get up and running with Windows 10 IoT. Here, Michael explains how to build a simple, hardware breadboard setup to validate your development environment.
