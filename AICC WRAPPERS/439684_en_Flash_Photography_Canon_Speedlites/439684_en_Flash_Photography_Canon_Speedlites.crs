[Course_Description]
Did you buy a Canon speedlight hoping to start making well-lit pictures, only to find the menus and buttons so confusing that it just sits in the box? In this course, you'll learn how to quickly set up your speedlight for both on-camera and off-camera operation. You'll also find out how to set up your Canon camera itself to make the most of the speedlightâ€”one of the most liberating photography tools you can buy. Levi Sim helps you master the controls, including the camera and flash modes, flash modifiers, and accessories, and creative options offered by a speedlight: soft light, hard light, and bounced light. By the end of this course, you'll be able to make great light in any situation with your speedlight. If you don't have one yet, you'll understand just what model is best for your needs and what features you'll use the most.
