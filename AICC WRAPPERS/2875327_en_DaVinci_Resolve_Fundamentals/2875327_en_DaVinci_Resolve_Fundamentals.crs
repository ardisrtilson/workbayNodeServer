[Course_Description]
Are you new to DaVinci Resolve? Are you intrigued by the power of this digital video media creation tool? Do you find the power of this tool intimidating or confusing? Then this title is for you. Join instructor and professional colorist Patrick Inhofer in this course designed to get you up to speed in as little time as possible. This course includes a 60-second commercial for you to work with so you can get comfortable with the layout and workflow as you follow along. Patrick starts with the process of importing your media, using both manual and automated tools, before showing how to start building a rough cut in Resolve. He then explains how to refine your rough cut using trim tools and adding titles and transitions, details the important aspects of color correction, and shows how to organize and mix sound clips. Patrick finishes the course covering the export process, showing how to use preset templates as well as how to create your own reusable custom templates.
