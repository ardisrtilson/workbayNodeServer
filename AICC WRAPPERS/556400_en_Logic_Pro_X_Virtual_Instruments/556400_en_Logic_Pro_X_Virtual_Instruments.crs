The virtual instruments inside Logic Pro X are some of the main tools used for creating the music we know and hear everywhere. In this course, author Evan Sutton explores ways you can use the virtual instruments found in this industry-leading, professional audio product from Apple. Evan shares a comprehensive examination of the vintage instruments in Logic, including the B3 and Clav, basic synthesizers like the ES 1 Subtractive Synth and ES P Polyphonic Synth, advanced synthesizers including the ES 2 Hybrid Synth and Retro Synth, the EXS24 sampler, and other major instruments including Alchemy, Sculpture, Drum Kit Designer, and Ultrabeat. He covers working with oscillators and filters, understanding modulation, designing sounds, routing, mapping, slicing, and much more.
