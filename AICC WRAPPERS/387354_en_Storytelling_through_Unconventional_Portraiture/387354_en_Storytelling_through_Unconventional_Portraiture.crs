[Course_Description]
The standard photo essay is typically a collection of photographs documenting real events happening in front of the camera. Telling a story without action—with only portraits—creates a few challenges for the photographer. In this course, photojournalist Paul Taggart shows how using different types of portrait photography and selecting subjects that visually add to the narrative can tell a full and colorful story.
