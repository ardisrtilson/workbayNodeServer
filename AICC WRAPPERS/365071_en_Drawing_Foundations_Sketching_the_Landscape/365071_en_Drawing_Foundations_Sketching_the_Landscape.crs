[Course_Description]
Learn how to quickly capture the atmosphere and mood of a landscape like an artist, and take the next step from sketching at home to sketching outside. This course includes an introduction to the materials you'll need to draw outdoors, as well as 7 practical principles to creating successful landscape sketches, combining drawing theory, on-location drawing demonstrations, and studio-based drawing tutorials. Author Will Kemp, founder of the Will Kemp Art School, shows how to capture, compose, and balance the scene in front of you and take your ideas back to the studio for further refinement.
