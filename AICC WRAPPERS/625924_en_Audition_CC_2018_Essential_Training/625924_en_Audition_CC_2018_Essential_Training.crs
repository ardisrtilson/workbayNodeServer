[Course_Description]
Discover how to professionally edit and mix audio with Adobe Audition CC. In this course, instructor Paul Murphy begins by touring the Audition interface and providing a crash course in fixing noisy audio from a Premiere Pro project. He then continues with a more detailed overview of the software, including topics such as importing, editing, improving sound elements with effects and the Essential Sound panel, integration with Premiere Pro, and finally, exporting your mix. For editors who have traditionally completed audio work inside their editing system, this course can show you powerful tools and expert techniques to take your audio mixes to the next level.
