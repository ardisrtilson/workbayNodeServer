[Course_Description]
By taking the time to develop thoughtful learning goals and outcomes, you can enhance the quality of your instruction—and potentially save yourself from needing to deal with frustrating situations without a game plan. In this short course, Oliver Schinkten explores how to develop a curriculum that not only identifies learning objectives for individual lessons, but also informs pedagogy and assessment strategies. He discusses the crucial components of curriculum development, including how to create learning objectives, consider the scope and sequence, deliver high-quality feedback, and make your learning materials accessible to all learners. Plus, he explains how to plan for the unexpected, and modify your instruction to ensure that it evolves to meet the needs of your learners.
