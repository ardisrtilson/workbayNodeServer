Industrial design is at the intersection of culture, technology, and business. As design in general has grown increasingly more accessible, a solid understanding of industrial design has become an even more valuable asset. In this course, instructor Scott Clear examines industrial design at a high level, and provides practical examples of what a career in industrial design looks like. Scott discusses traditional commercial practices of industrial design, helping you better grasp the knowledge, methodologies, and tools that advance successful design development. Learn about the role of storytelling in design, review a case study of an actual designer, and more.
