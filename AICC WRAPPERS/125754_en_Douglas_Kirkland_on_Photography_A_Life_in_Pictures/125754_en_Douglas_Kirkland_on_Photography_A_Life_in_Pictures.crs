[Course_Description]
Photographer. Photojournalist. Industry legend. Douglas Kirkland has been taking pictures for over 50 years. He's built an archive of more than a million imagesâ€”a body of work that grows larger every day. For the first time, Douglas has assembled a collection that celebrates the complete scope of his photography, laid out in a new book called A Life in Pictures. This documentary follows him as he selects images for the book, reviews the proofs, and receives the final print, while recalling the most pivotal moments in his career. Hear stories about working with Hollywood greats and learn the history behind cameras from his extensive collection, including the Kodak Brownie that started it all.
