[Course_Description]
While the mentorship-apprenticeship model is as old as the trade guilds, one’s ability to mentor plays a deeper role in today’s complex business environment. Strategic mentorship, which emphasizes professional growth through the mentorship of others, is no longer an option, but an imperative for effective leadership. In this course, join Sanyin Siang—the executive director of the Fuqua/Coach K Center on Leadership & Ethics (COLE) at Duke University—as she explains how to become a strategic mentor in your organization. After highlighting the benefits and potential outcomes of strategic mentoring, Sanyin shares specific tactics for promoting your own personal growth as you develop talent within your organization.
