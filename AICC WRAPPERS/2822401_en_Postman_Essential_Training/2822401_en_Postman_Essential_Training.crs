[Course_Description]
Automated API testing is one of the most efficient ways to ensure that an API is behaving as expectedâ€”faster and far superior to automated UI testing. For testers and developers responsible for API testing, Postman is a popular and free solution. It offers a rich interface for writing test cases and features for automation, such as the ability to reuse tests and integrate collections into a CI build system like Jenkins. This course introduces the process of writing, running, and automating API tests with Postman. Instructor Kristin Jackvony shows how to create a complete test collection; create easy and advanced assertions, including nested JSON assertions; run collections with the built-in collection runner and the command-line runner, Newman; and configure automatic runs in Jenkins projects.
