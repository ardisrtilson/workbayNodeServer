There are more opportunities than ever to get your ideas in front of large audiences. You have TV, radio, and digital news, but you also have podcasts and social media sites. Many of these interviews can also be conducted from almost anywhere in the world.

As a former Emmy Award-winning TV news reporter, Jessica knows firsthand the kinds of questions interviewers ask, and how you can navigate the conversation strategically using your words, tone of voice, and body language. After watching this course, youâ€™ll be better prepared to project confidence and control your own narrative in all media interview settings.
