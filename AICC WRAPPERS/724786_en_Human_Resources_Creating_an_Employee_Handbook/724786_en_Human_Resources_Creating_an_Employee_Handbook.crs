Truly effective employee handbooks don't just help companies remain compliant with the lawâ€”they can also express an organization's culture and vision. In this course, join veteran attorney Don Phin as he discusses the legal reasons to have a handbook, the cultural aspects of this important document, and how to share your finished handbook with employees. Don goes over a variety of key topics, including codes of conduct, at-will employment and other disclaimers, leave management policies, preventing sexual harassment and other employment claims, and using the handbook to reflect your company culture. Plus, discover how to use today's digital technologies to bring your employee handbook to life.
