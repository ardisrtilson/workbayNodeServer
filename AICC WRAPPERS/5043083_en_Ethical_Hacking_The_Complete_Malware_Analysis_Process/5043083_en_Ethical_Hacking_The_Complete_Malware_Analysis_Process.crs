[Course_Description]
The key to effectively protecting your systems is understanding the attacks you have to defend them against. This course introduces the different types of malware (malicious software) that can be used to exploit a target computer. It covers viruses and worms—malware which can propagate itself onto other computers through removable media or networks—as well as Trojans and backdoors. Instructor Malcolm Shore explains where malware hides, and how you can detect it to protect your networks and systems against cyberattack. He reverse-engineers malware so you can see how it operates, and explains how attackers create malware using automated malware construction kits called “botnets.” Along the way, Malcolm introduces malware analysis tools that are useful for the career of any IT professional.
