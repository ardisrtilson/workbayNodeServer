[Course_Description]
Interested in writing your own songs? GarageBand is a natural place to start. It's an accessible program anyone can turn to when inspiration strikes. In this short course, author Garrick Chow teaches 9 basic steps to writing, recording, and mixing a song in GarageBand. He starts from an empty GarageBand project, records scratch tracks, and finds the best tempo for the new song idea. Then he creates a beat, lays down additional tracks, and adds effects. Next he shows techniques for recording and combining multiple takes, and arranging the song using GarageBand's Arrangement Track. Finally, he shows how to create a rough mix and then how to bounce down the track and share it with the world. Want to learn about other tools for songwriting? Check out Songwriting in Pro Tools.
