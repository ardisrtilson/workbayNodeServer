Having more alignment in your life is a proven way to feel more balanced, motivated, and passionate about how you spend your time. This course, taught by communications coach and entrepreneur Christina Vo, navigates how to align your values throughout all avenues of your life. Christina first reviews the basics of alignment, including its importance to overall well-being. She then walks you through a reflection exercise to get clear on personal values and passions, and discusses how these values can impact the type of work you enjoy and how you work most effectively. Finally, Christina explores how you can embody your values in other aspects of life, such as in relationships or stress management. Upon completion of this course, you will have the tools to reflect on your alignment and continue to grow in this arena. This course was created by Madecraft.
