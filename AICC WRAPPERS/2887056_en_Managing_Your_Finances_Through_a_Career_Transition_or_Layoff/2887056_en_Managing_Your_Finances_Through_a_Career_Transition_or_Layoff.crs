Career transitions, whether planned or unexpected, trigger a barrage of time-sensitive financial planning questions. How much money do you need to fund your bottom line? What steps can you take to maintain health insurance coverage between jobs? In this course, longtime financial adviser Winnie Sun answers these questions and more, providing practical advice designed to help you survive a gap in income triggered by a layoff or career change. Discover how to leverage your assets during a transition, get your spending under control, and create a financial first-aid kit designed to help you plan your next steps. Plus, learn how to use COBRA to keep your insurance, roll over retirement funds, and start a new job with renewed financial goals.
