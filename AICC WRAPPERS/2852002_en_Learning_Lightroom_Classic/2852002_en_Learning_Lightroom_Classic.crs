[Course_Description]
Powerful, affordable, and available for macOS and Windows alike, Adobe Lightroom has become an extremely popular program for photographers of all experience levels. In this course, Theresa Jackson provides an approachable introduction to Lightroom Classic—the original Lightroom. The course begins with a look at what Lightroom Classic is—a program for organizing, enhancing, and sharing photos—and a tour of the workspace and modules. Theresa then takes you through a four-step workflow starting with how to import photos into the Lightroom catalog followed by organizing your catalog with keywords, ratings, collections, and automatic facial recognition. Next she introduces the Lightroom Develop module and its features for improving a photo’s appearance, including cropping, camera profiles, sharpening and noise reduction, and automatic adjustment tools. The course ends with a look at the most commonly used Lightroom features for sharing photos: exporting and printing.
