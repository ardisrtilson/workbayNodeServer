[Course_Description]
The independent contractor (IC) workforce continues to grow in the U.S. There are times when this relationship is looked upon favorably by the law, and times when it is not. Independent contractor status triggers numerous concerns, including liability exposures, insurance coverages, tax payment obligations, property ownership, employee status, benefits eligibility, and more. This course was designed to help HR executives, recruiters, and others in management stay on the right side of the law when it comes to hiring and managing independent contractors. Learn about the legal requirements for classifying ICs, the benefits of hiring ICs, how to prevent misclassification claims, and more.
