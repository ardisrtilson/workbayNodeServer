Whether you work in product, sales, accounting, IT, or marketing, the ability to garner emotional buy-in is essential to making the initiatives and projects you lead more successful. In this course, join leadership coaches Lisa Earle McLeod and Elizabeth McLeod as they share how to determine which situations require emotional buy-in, who to engage, and what to say. They explain how to respond to those who may be less than enthusiastic about your initiatives, and how you can neutralize the naysayers. Plus, they discuss how to rebound quickly from setbacks and sustain long-term enthusiasm.
