[Course_Description]
Designers must know how to choose the right paper for every print job. Paper is where design leaps off of the screen and into your hands. The right weight, feel, and finish help the reader understand the purpose and importance of the design. This course helps you understand how to maximize this oh-so-important material to make your printed projects not only come out the way you envision, but also more beautiful, effective, and memorable. Chris Harrold of Mohawk Paper teaches the basics of paper, including physical attributes like color and finish, and shows how to select the right paper for a project and ensure the best results on press. Altogether, this course helps you take full advantage of one of the most important elements of any print project, and choose paper to support any type of design, from luxury packaging to short-run press projects.
