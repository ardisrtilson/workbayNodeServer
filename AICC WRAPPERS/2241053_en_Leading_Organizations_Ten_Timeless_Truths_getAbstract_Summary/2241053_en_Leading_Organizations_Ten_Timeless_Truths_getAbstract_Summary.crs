[Course_Description]
McKinsey senior partners Scott Keller and Mary Meaney examined 20 years of queries to their firm and went through Harvard Business Review articles since 1976 to identify the most important, queried, and written-about management topics in that time span. They found “ten timeless truths about leadership and management practices and compiled them in a well-referenced manual: Leading Organizations: Ten Timeless Truths. In this audio-only summary of their book, produced by getAbstract, Keller and Meaney provide a smart introduction to the most important tasks for any leader. Even if the authors only spark your further reading and research, their 10 overviews—including concrete, applicable steps and case studies—provide a great place to start, especially if you’re new to leadership. This audiobook summary was created by getAbstract, the world’s largest provider of business book summaries. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
