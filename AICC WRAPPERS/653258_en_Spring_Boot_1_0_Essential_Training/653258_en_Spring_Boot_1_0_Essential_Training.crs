[Course_Description]
Learn how to get started with Spring Boot, a powerful framework to build web applications quickly, using less code. The Java-based programs you build in Spring Boot just run: they resolve their own dependencies and create containers for running code in any environment. Learn how to use Spring Boot to build your projects in this course with software architect and Spring developer Frank Moley. Frank shows how to initialize, package, and run Spring Boot web apps and CLI apps, and use the library of common starter projects to fill business-critical needs: data, messaging, security, and more. Plus, find how to extend Spring Boot by creating your own starters and use the Actuator module's HTTP endpoints to monitor and manage your apps.
