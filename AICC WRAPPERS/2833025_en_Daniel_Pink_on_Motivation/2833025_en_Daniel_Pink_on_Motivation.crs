[Course_Description]
The central task of leaders and managers is to help their people perform at their best and contribute the most. In this course, join #1 New York Times best-selling author Daniel Pink as he shares science-backed methods for effectively motivating others. With his trademark clarity, Pink distills the crucial research on human motivation. And he shares practical takeaways in the three key areas lead to enduring high performance: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Pink teaches a group exercise to help surface your team’s purpose, then shows you how to create a sense of connection. He explains the secrets of effective feedback and how to promote progress using simple 90-second practices. And since offering employees space to make small changes in their jobs can dramatically boost engagement, Pink walks you through how to carve out small islands of autonomy to spark your team’s innovation and deepen their commitment.
