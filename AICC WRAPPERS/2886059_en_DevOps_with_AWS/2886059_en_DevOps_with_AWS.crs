DevOps describes a culture and set of processes that bring development and operations teams together to simplify software development. It allows organizations to create and improve products at a faster pace than they can deliver with traditional software development approaches. And itâ€™s gaining in popularity at a rapid rate.

She covers AWS services like CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline, and how to implement DevOps with AWS offerings to increase security, scalability, reliability, and simplicity of the development processes.
