[Course_Description]
Grammar is one of those topics that leaves even confident writers scratching their heads. But Grammar Girl, aka Mignon Fogarty, realized there was another way to teach it: Grammar could be fun! She started recording a podcast in her closet, which quickly became a website, a series of books—and a phenomenon, reaching over 50 million listeners. Find out how Grammar Girl evolved into the Quick and Dirty Tips network and led Mignon to develop her own iOS app—and see how she's using crowdfunding to support the development of her next venture: a board game called Peeve Wars.
