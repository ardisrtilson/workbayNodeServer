[Course_Description]
Digital disruption is changing every business. Only a decade ago, the auto industry was well-defined by players such as GM, Ford, and Toyota. Today, these companies compete with newcomers such as Uber and Lyft, which sell transportation services—not cars. Similar dynamics are playing out in retail, banking, education, and even construction. This course examines how digitization reshapes the opportunities and threats facing companies—and how you can harness the power of digitization to win. Join Anil Gupta and Haiyan Wang to learn how to develop your own digital strategy. Discover how to harness artificial intelligence, use new platforms to beat the competition, and digitize products, services, and other elements of the value chain: design, development, sourcing, production, and distribution.
