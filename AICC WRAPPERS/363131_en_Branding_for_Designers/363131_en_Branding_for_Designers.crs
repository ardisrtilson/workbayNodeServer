[Course_Description]
Branding goes beyond logos, brochures, and website designs. Branding is a complete system for communicating a company's unique message. In this course, Sean Adams asks designers to move past one-off projects and partner with their client on a holistic branding approach. The lessons he provides help explain exactly what branding is, underline the importance of research and problem-solving in design, and define how branding elements like logos, wordmarks, icons, and color palettes all work together to tell a brand's story. He also shows how to hand off branding systems to clients and provide the documentation and long-term support to sustain their brands far into the future.
