[Course_Description]
An effective photo of a building captures the personality of the architecture and its designer's vision. In this course, photographer Richard Klein demonstrates key techniques for taking exterior photos that make a building look its best. He visits two sites, one featuring a large modern home and the other a Japanese-style building, and covers a variety of lighting techniques, from working with existing light to employing supplemental lighting.
