[Course_Description]
Review the history of strategy—the art of creating power—in this audio-only summary of the book by Sir Lawrence Freedman, a leading authority on war and strategic analysis. Freedman discusses the universality of strategic thinking and proceeds to lead readers on an expedition through the history of the Western world, tracing the development of strategic thought in warfare, politics, and business. One of his major themes is that even the best strategy can do no more than attempt to subdue a complex and recalcitrant world. This audio-only summary from getAbstract distills the most important lessons from his book. As Freedman writes, “Strategy is about power and how to create it, but it is also about the ability to understand the limitations of power.” This audiobook summary was created by getAbstract, the world’s largest provider of business book summaries. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
