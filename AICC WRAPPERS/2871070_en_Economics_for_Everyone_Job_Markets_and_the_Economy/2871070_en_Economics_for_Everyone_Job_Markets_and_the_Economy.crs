[Course_Description]
The labor market is much more than headline numbers. And understanding its nuances can give you an edge. In this course, get an economist's guide to the nuances of the job market, and discover how to leverage labor market data to get ahead in your job search. Economics and finance expert Jason Schenker provides in-depth coverage of the impact of economics on job markets, highlighting the differences between unemployment and joblessness, the dynamics impacting wages and job creation, and the ways in which online jobs data can be both valuable and limiting. Jason also delves into the ways that people are impacted differently in the job market, including how historical data illustrates racial disparities and inequalities, as well as how labor trends differ greatly by gender and age. Plus, uncover significant opportunities in unemployment data that varies greatly by state, city, and country.
