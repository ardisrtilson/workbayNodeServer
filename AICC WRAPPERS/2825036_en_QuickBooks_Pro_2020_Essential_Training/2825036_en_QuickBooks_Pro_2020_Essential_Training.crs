[Course_Description]
QuickBooks is designed to make running a business easy, so you can focus on what you do best. Learn how to create and back up your company's QuickBooks file and quickly set up shop, in this introductory course. It starts with adding your banking information, credit cards, and historical data to the chart of accounts. You can also learn how to set up your customers, vendors, employees, and inventory items. Instructor Jess Stratton then takes you through the day-to-day operations that keep your business running: creating estimates, purchase orders, invoices, and sales receipts; processing payments; recording deposits; and printing checks. Plus, learn how to run reports; find data about your business; and close the books, with end-of-year preparations.
