[Course_Description]
How do we train the next generation of artists? An art education can be incredibly expensive when pursued at the college level (up to $250,000!), and it doesn't guarantee a well-paid job. Meanwhile, art is conspicuously absent from most K-12 schools. Professor and illustrator Bryn Barnard offers solutions to these problems in this fascinating presentation on art education. Learn how two-year atelier training, integration of art into STEM-driven curriculum, art science, and IB Art programs can help students transition from making art to thinking artâ€”using art to solve all sorts of creative challenges.
