[Course_Description]
Mona Ataya began her journey as an entrepreneur by selling chewing gum in grade school. Now, she runs Mumzworld—the leading mother, baby, and child ecommerce site in the Arab world—and was named one of Forbes top ten Arab entrepreneurs for two years in a row. In this course, adapted from the podcast al empire, Mona talks with co-host Hebah Fisher about redefining “the working mother.” Mona shares her early experiences growing up in a family of entrepreneurs. She recounts how she uses her family’s love of sharing ideas to inspire her children to learn about the world around them. Mona tells how returning to work after having her twins inspired her next startup: developing a website that would help mothers feel empowered to be the best moms they can be. Mumzworld is now a thriving business, and Mona plans to continue that success by expanding the community. Note: This course was created by al empire. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
