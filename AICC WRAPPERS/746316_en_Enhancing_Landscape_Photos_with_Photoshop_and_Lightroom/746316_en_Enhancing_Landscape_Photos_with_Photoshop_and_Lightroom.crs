[Course_Description]
Great landscape photographs capture the raw beauty of the wildernessâ€”but in order to make these images shine, post-production work is often needed. In this course, Ben Long focuses on the post-production tools and techniques that can help you tackle the unique challenges of landscape photography. Ben begins by demonstrating how to make global adjustments, including how to crop and straighten your images and adjust the tone and color. He then shares how to make localized tone and color adjustments in both Lightroom and Photoshop, as well as how to enhance your photos by thinking like a painter.
