[Course_Description]
Both in business and personal life, having the skill to approach a stranger or strike up a conversation with an acquaintance in a new context can be very useful. Memorable conversations can open doors and change career trajectories, but being the person to speak first doesnâ€™t come naturally to all of us. In this course, author Tatiana Kolovou shares a formula for starting meaningful exchanges in any situation and teaches how to conduct an appropriate and memorable conversation. You can also learn about how to avoid common difficulties and find the right way to end a conversation.
