[Course_Description]
Millions of people who used to work in offices now work from home, and with this change in workplace dynamics comes a whole new set of concerns and logistical challenges. Instead of worrying about commutes, business travel, or booking conference rooms, workers and organizations now need to find new and effective ways to connect for conferences, all-staff meetings, and other events that used to take place face to face. In this course, Gini von Courter shows how to use Microsoft 365 Live Events to help meet these challenges by providing live video streaming for meetings with up to 10,000 participants. Gini shows how to keep things running smoothly before, during, and after a live event. She covers key topics like choosing the right tool from the M365 building blocks—Teams, Yammer, and Stream—for a live event, scheduling live events and assigning roles, using an external encoder, starting the live stream, and hosting post-event conversations and managing event recordings and reports.
