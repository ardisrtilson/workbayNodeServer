[Course_Description]
The United States has many restrictions on private sector information use. These regulations protect consumers and children, as well as patients, students, investors, and anyone who has an email address or phone number. In this course, Mike Chapple explains the regulations governing the use of personal data, as covered by the second domain of the IAPP Certified Information Privacy Professional/US (CIPP/US) exam. He discusses privacy issues related to medical, financial, educational, and telecommunications records, as well as current and future enforcement actions that may be taken against organizations that break the law. Students who complete this course will be prepared to answer questions from the Limits on Private Sector Collection and Use of Data domain of the CIPP/US examâ€”a critical certification for privacy professionals.
