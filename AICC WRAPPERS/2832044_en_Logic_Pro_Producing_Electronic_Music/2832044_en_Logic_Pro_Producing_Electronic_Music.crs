[Course_Description]
Electronic music is an umbrella term for a wide variety of genres and sounds, from ambient, dub, acid house, trap, drum and bass, dubstep, and more. But whatever style you produce, Logic Pro can handle it. This powerful DAW is uniquely suited to capturing your creativity and expressing your sonic ideas. In this course, instructor Nate Mars shows you the core techniques professionals use to produce electronic music in Logic Pro. He starts with building the foundation of the track—the drums. He shows how to program beats in Ultrabeat, utilize your own samples, and create drumbeats for a variety of genres. He then moves into creating basslines for house, trap, dubstep, and other genres, and getting a great deep sub-bass sound. He next moves into creating lead synth sounds, starting with Logic Pro's built-in Alchemy and Retro synths. He also goes into using samples and adding sound effects. Then he pulls it all together and demonstrates ways to arrange the tracks, use creative effects, mix the tracks together, and use automation to finalize the mix. Plus, learn how to send your MIDI note and clock data to external synths from Logic Pro X—a fun way to experiment with analog sounds.
