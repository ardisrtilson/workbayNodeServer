[Course_Description]
One of the more challenging photo restoration tasks involves recomposing a photo: moving two people closer together, for example. In this project-based course, master photo restorationist Neil Rhodes shows how to do just that. After evaluating the task and planning the recomposition approach, Neil shows how to use selections and masks to remove and reinsert a person in the scene. Next, he shows how to reconstruct the background details that the person was obscuring. Finally, he details how to adjust the lighting, scale, and shadows to ensure realism.
