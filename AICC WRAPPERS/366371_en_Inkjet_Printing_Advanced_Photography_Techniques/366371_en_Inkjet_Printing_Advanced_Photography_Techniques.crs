[Course_Description]
Making your own ink-jet prints is easy. Making great ink-jet prints isn't. It takes practice and experience to know how images that you're viewing on a computer screen will translate to the printed page. Along the way, you can spend a lot of money on wasted paper and ink. This course, from photographer and educator Ben Long, is designed to help you improve your printing eye. Ben walks you through a variety of black-and-white and color images, explaining what he likes about them, and sharing insights on how to get the best print from it. Then it's your turn: using Ben's advice and Photoshop, you get to correct the images and print them on your own ink-jet printer. Then tune back in for Ben's solution to each challenge. This is a guided master class in the art of ink-jet printing.
