Google Forms is the free, easy, and fun way to collect data online. In this course, LinkedIn Learning staff instructor Jess Stratton shows you everything you need to know to create surveys and collect responses with Google Forms. Jess walks you through the process of building forms, including how to design your form, add questions, and insert images and videos, as well as leveraging the built-in templates. Next, Jess shows how to work with your survey responses, including customizing response settings, sending the form to recipients, viewing and analyzing response data, and closing out the form for future responses. Finally, learn how to take your forms further by applying filters and charts, analyzing data in Excel, and embedding forms on webpages.
