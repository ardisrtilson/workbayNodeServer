[Course_Description]
Adobe Dimension is an easy-to-use 3D design application created to help graphic artists and photographers—particularly those lacking previous 3D experience—achieve photorealistic 3D effects. In this course, instructor Theresa Jackson goes beyond the basics of what Dimension can do, sharing practical tips designed to help 2D artists break into a 3D workflow. After covering basic concepts about working with 3D models—including how to tackle common challenges that can crop up when you’re working with third-party models—Theresa dives into Illustrator workflows. Learn how to set up label designs and patterns with Illustrator artboards and edit in Illustrator from Dimension. Plus, learn about Photoshop workflows, including how to create image materials and material properties with Photoshop.
