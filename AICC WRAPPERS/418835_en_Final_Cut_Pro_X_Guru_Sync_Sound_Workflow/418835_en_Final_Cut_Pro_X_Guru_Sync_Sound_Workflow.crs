[Course_Description]
Recording dual audio, the practice of recording audio separately from the camera, started originally with film. It's become a common practice with the current crop of DSLR and cinema cameras. The challenge for editors is matching the video and audio in post. Luckily, Final Cut Pro X has amazing ability to sync your mediaâ€”and it gets even better when you incorporate the powerful third-party plugin PluralEyes. This course will help you quickly master the nuances of this workflow, save time, and get the best results when syncing media in Final Cut Pro.
