[Course_Description]
Photographers shoot film for its unique look; its constraints, which require discipline and careful self-editing; and the simple fact that developing film is fun and gratifying. And you don't need a darkroom to do it. In this course, photographer and master printer Konrad Eek provides an introduction to the pleasures of shooting and processing black-and-white film. The course begins with a look at gear and film cameras, which are inexpensive and widely available at thrift stores and secondhand shops. Next, we accompany Konrad on a photo shoot in the mountains of Arkansas, where he demonstrates important concepts such as metering and the use of filters. Upon returning home, Konrad processes the film, explaining the chemicals involved and sharing insights for getting reliable results. He also describes the negative-scanning process. Finally, to whet your appetite for the other facets of film-based photography, he demonstrates the process of making a silver-gelatin enlargement and offers up some tips on building your own darkroom.
