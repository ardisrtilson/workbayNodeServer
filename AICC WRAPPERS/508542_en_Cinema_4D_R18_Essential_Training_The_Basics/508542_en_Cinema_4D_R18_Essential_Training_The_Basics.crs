CINEMA 4D R18: The Basics introduces artists to the CINEMA 4D workflow, using CINEMA 4D as part of a pipeline that includes artwork from Adobe Illustrator and finishing touches in After Effects. Author Andy Needham explains the concepts and techniques that are crucial to understanding exactly how this 3D modeling software functions. Learn how to model objects, extrude shapes, animate the model and the camera in your scene, apply lighting and materials, and render out a fully realized 3D animation. Each step follows the development of a real-world motion graphics project—a 3D logo—so you can see C4D's features in action.
