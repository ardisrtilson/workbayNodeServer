[Course_Description]
A cross-functional team is a group of people with different functional expertise working toward a common goalâ€”and can include people from finance, marketing, operations, and human resources. Because everyone has their own priorities, cross-functional teams can be challenging to lead. Team demands compete with the day-to-day demands that team members face from their own departments, and the team leader often has to rely more on influence than direct control. In this course, leadership trainer and executive coach Mike Figliuolo outlines the skills needed to successfully manage a cross-functional team, explains how to communicate effectively with team members, and shares how to resolve conflict when it arises.
