Audio shouldn't be an afterthought when it comes to video production. It's half the picture. But many people who shoot with DSLRs don't monitor or supplement the sound that comes from their camera. This installment of DSLR Video Tips answers the most common questions about recording audio for video: Why does my audio sound so bad? How do I use a dedicated audio recorder? Which type of microphone should I use? What adapters do I need? How do I sync soundâ€”in the field and in post? Authors Rich Harrington and Robbie Carman offer simple solutions that will help you capture high-quality audio without a lot of expensive gear. Plus, get run-and-gun techniques for getting clean audio in noisy settings, syncing audio with video in post, and using click tracks to capture great live music performances.
