Learn the creative and technical considerations involved in photographing with compositing in mind. Seán Duggan reviews the key elements of any compositing library, and then shows how to go out into the field and into the studio to capture the photographs you need to round out your own image library. He also reviews using props to expand your creative options and some simple post-processing techniques for creating different types of composites in Photoshop.
