[Course_Description]
You’ve settled into the rhythm of remote work. Having a full schedule of virtual team meetings, presentations, and even social events no longer seems quite so peculiar. But even at this stage, there’s so much more you can do to create a more engaged, positive, and inclusive environment for your remote team. In this course, remote work consultant and educator Mike Gutman shows you how. Mike covers a variety of advanced strategies for working remotely, including how to transform a culture of micromanagement into a culture of trust; make your tasks, projects, and timelines transparent to other members of your team; and keep your team bonds strong by sharing your communication style and preferences. Plus, get tips for building empathy, embracing diverse working conditions within your remote teams, and creating a psychologically safe environment where people feel encouraged to bring their voice and ideas to the table.
