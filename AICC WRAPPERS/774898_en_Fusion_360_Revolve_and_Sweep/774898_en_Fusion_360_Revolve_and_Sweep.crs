[Course_Description]
The Revolve and Sweep tools in Fusion 360 give engineers, product designers, and industrial designers the ability to create complex shapes that would otherwise be difficult to build. In this course, discover how to create 3D models using the Revolve and Sweep features in this powerful 3D design and fabrication tool. Autodesk Certified instructor Jomarc Baquiran demonstrates how to utilize the Revolve and Sweep features, explaining how sketches as profiles, axis, and paths factor into the process. To provide you with a practical understanding of these features, Jomarc demonstrates how to use Revolve and Sweep to create the wheels, basket, and legs of a supermarket cart.
