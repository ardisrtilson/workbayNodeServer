[Course_Description]
Cybersecurity can be daunting because of its technical complexity and the ever-changing threats that professionals must grapple with. And more than ever, cybersecurity is not just an IT issue, but a core business issue for organizations of all kinds. Just like other business issues—such as finance, legal, or human resources—cybersecurity has its own set of external policies, laws, rules, established practices, and resources for getting help. Getting to know these policies and resources better across your organization—and not just within your IT department—can be hugely beneficial to your company. This course seeks to make key cybersecurity policies and resources clear and understandable—whether you work in IT, in business, or are just interested in how information security fits in with our public policies and laws.
