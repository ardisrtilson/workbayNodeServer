[Course_Description]
Get ready to broaden your photographic horizons. In this course, photographer and educator Justin Reznick dives into a variety of techniques and options designed to expand your photography skills. Try your hand at multiple exposures, both in camera and created in Photoshop. Experiment with intentional camera movement (ICM) to convey a sense of motion, and see how texture blending can add a new dimension to a subject. Justin wraps up by helping you pair your photos with famous Impressionist works to turn your images into striking creative impressions.
