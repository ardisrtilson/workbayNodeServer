[Course_Description]
Markers are an essential part of workflows for many editors. Having a firm grasp of how they work in Adobe Premiere Pro can help you use the program more effectively. You can use markers to help you remember steps still to be done, or to communicate with other editors sharing the project. You can also use markers to create web links, DVD chapter stops, or even to edit your clips to music. In this course, Luisa Winters explains why markers are important to the editing process, and goes into the different types of markers you can access in Premiere Pro and how to use them.
