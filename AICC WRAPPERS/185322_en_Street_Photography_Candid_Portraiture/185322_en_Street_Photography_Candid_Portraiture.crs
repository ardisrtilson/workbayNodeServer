[Course_Description]
Street photography is an exercise in the art of observation: paying attention to the theater that goes on in every city and town, and capturing moments that tell stories. In this course, photographer and educator Steve Simon hits the streets of New York City to share insights on the art of candid street photography, from gear choices to shooting techniques. Steve shows how to immerse yourself in the thick of things, overcome your nerves, and adjust your camera to respond as quickly as possible. Along the way, you'll get an inside look at some of the most photogenic locations in New York City: a busy Midtown intersection, Highline Park, Times Square, and the 9/11 Memorial.
