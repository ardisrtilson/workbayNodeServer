When it comes to closing deals, stellar presentations aren’t always enough to clinch a sale. Effectively following up with prospects after a sales meeting is critical—and failing to do so can cause a once-promising deal to go cold. In this course, Steve Benson, a top sales coach and expert, shares practical strategies for following up with prospects in a way that keeps the momentum of a great sales meeting going. Learn the ingredients for a powerful follow-up; how to tackle common objections such as “I’ll think about it”; and how to evade common pitfalls, including which phrases to avoid in your follow-up email or calls.
