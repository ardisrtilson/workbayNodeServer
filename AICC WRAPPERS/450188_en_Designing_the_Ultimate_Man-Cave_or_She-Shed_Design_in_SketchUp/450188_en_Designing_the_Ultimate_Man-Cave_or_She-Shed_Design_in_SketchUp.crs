[Course_Description]
We all want a room to call our own. Personal structures like man caves and she sheds give you a hideaway from life stresses. Do you want a light and airy garden structure to curl up with a good book or to enjoy conversation with a friend, or would a lounge with a minibar where you can watch the game while working on your motorcycle be your idea of a good time? SketchUp, the easiest, most fun, entirely free 3D drawing tool in the world, is the perfect program to design your unique space. Join Scott Onstott in this course, as he shows how to model an existing structure like a garage and transform it into a personal sanctuary with SketchUp's intuitive 3D toolset. Discover how to model walls, doors, windows, furniture, and even a private bathroom, and finesse your design with lighting and shading.
