[Course_Description]
The future of work is here. Meetings that once filled conference rooms are now fully online. Dining room tables have been turned into makeshift offices. And technology is playing an ever-increasing role in our day-to-day workflows. But what about our emotional well-being and sense of belonging? HR exec and talent consultant Pat Wadors contends that, in the midst of all this change, another concurrent shift needs to be happeningâ€”one towards greater inclusion. In this course, Pat explains how to build a compassionate, inclusive work environment where employees can thrive as they adjust to our new normal. Discover how to apply inclusive design to your work. Learn about the difference between empathy and compassion and the role inclusion plays in the development of organizational resilience. Get tips for discussing mental health issues openly, and without judgment. Plus, learn how to take a cue from Maslow's hierarchy of needs to keep your employees' emotional well-being top of mind.
