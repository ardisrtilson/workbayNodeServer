[Course_Description]
Appium is the most popular and comprehensive tool for automating mobile application testing. Write scripts in any language—Java, Python, Ruby, or JavaScript—and test on any device: iOS or Android. Anyone involved in mobile QA who wants to save time and energy on testing should have at least a basic understanding of Appium. In this course, Jonathan Lipps, Appium project lead, takes you through the code-based automation workflow in Appium. Discover how to prepare your system for Appium, get it running, and set up a test code environment. Learn how to launch automation sessions with native mobile apps on iOS and Android and perform basic interactions with on-screen elements. From there Jonathan tackles more advanced topics, like synthesizing touch gestures. Each lesson helps you unlock new levels of quality and efficiency in your app development cycle.
