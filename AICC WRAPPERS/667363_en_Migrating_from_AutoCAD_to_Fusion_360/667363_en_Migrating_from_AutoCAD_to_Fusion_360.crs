[Course_Description]
AutoCAD users who are migrating to Fusion 360 will encounter tools, terminology, and workflows that may differ from what they're used to. Although both are Autodesk products, AutoCAD and Fusion 360 are dissimilar in several ways. This course explores the key elements of Fusion 360 that every experienced AutoCAD user needs to know before moving their work to Fusion 360. Instructor Jomarc Baquiran helps to prepare you to make the switch by going over similarities and differences between AutoCAD and Fusion 360, how to model and assemble 3D components, how to create 2D drawings, and more.
