[Course_Description]
DevOps engineers are in high demand, but the barriers to entering the field can be intimidating. DevOps roles require an intermediate to advanced knowledge of a wide set of tools and skills, from security to cloud services. If you've lined up an interview for a DevOps position, then you need to be able to showcase your mastery of these essential concepts. In this course, Michael Jenkins shares tips for answering common interview questions accurately and conciselyâ€”and, in turn, proving why you're the best candidate for the job. Michael covers general interview preparation; common DevOps skills you should know or become familiar with; cloud services (and why they're important); and business practices that are common to DevOps roles.
