[Course_Description]
Coding to databases—which often involves the use of boilerplate code that's difficult to maintain and debug—can be tedious work. Upgrading applications to a different kind of data storage is similarly challenging, as it usually involves massive code rewrites. Spring Data addresses these issues by abstracting data store interactions into a common repository API and eliminating boilerplate code. In this course, learn how to easily implement JPA-based repositories using Spring Data JPA. Mary Ellen Bowman describes the Spring Data umbrella project, and helps you understand JPA for object-relational mapping. She also covers querying, and dives into other Spring Data Commons features such as QueryDSL and auditing.
