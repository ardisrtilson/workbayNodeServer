[Course_Description]
In this audio-only course, host Zach Nunn discusses engagement and inclusion with Pamela Fuller of Franklin Covey. Pamela states that the best way to promote inclusivity is to reframe diversity around performance, not moral obligation. She and Zack explore ways that corporations can make sure all groups of people are welcomed and represented. Pamela describes the best ways to cultivate a corporate culture of retention and make employees feel valued, welcomed, and supported. Pamela concludes by describing the critical role that having honest conversations about bias plays in bringing unconscious bias to the surface, where it can be addressed. Zach Nunn is part of Living Corporate, a multimedia diversity, equity, and inclusion platform that centers and amplifies black and brown professionals in the workplace.
