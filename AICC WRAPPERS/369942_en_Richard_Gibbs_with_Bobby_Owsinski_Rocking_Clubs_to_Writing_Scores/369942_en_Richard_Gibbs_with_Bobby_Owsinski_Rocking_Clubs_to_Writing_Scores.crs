In this series, music producer Bobby Owsinski interviews iconic audio- and music-industry personalities: the outliers, forward thinkers, and rule breakers. This installment features legendary film composer Richard Gibbs. Richard started scoring surf films as a kid, and then became a touring musician with Chaka Khan and Tom Jones. He has been a session musician on over 150 albums, for artists such as Aretha Franklin, Tom Waits, and Robert Palmer, and was a member of Oingo Boingo. He has since returned to his first love, scoring film, and works on several projects a year. His credits include Say Anything, The Simpsons, and the reboot of Battlestar Galatica. In this interview, Bobby and Richard chat about Richard's career, influences, and inspirations.
