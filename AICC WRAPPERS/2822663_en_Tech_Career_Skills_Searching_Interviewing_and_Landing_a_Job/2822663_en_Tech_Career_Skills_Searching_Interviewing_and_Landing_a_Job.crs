[Course_Description]
Too many engineers focus on building hard technical skills, but do not receive the guidance or coaching necessary to make a strong case for their candidacy during the recruitment process. By focusing on the “what”—programming languages and infrastructure stacks—and the “how”—engineering and troubleshooting—they lose sight of the strategic “why. This context gap routinely hurts engineers when they apply for roles and when they try to present their point of view on the job. In this course, tech leader Nishant Bhajaria describes the tech recruitment process and explains how to present yourself on your resume, ask the right questions, and make your case in the interview. These soft skills are indispensable—giving you a better chance at landing the right role and succeeding in the actual job.
