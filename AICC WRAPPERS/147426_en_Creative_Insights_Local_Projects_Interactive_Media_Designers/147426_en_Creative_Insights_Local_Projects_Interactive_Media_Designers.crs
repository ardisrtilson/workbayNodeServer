Local Projects makes innovative multimedia designs for schools, museums, and public spaces. They aim to translate complex ideas like physics, art, and history into experiences that both educate and inspire. In this Creative Insights, founder Jake Barton explains how their unique cross-disciplinary workspace and prototype-first methodology lead to innovationâ€”and installations that age well. His team also explains how they developed projects for the Cleveland Museum of Art, the New York Hall of Science, and the 9/11 Memorial Museum.
