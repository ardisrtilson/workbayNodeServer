[Course_Description]
As your company grows, tracking key business processes becomes increasingly more complex. SAP Business One is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) tool built with small businesses in mind. As a small business, you may not need all the functionality—and cost—of SAP ERP, and SAP Business One may be a better solution for your tech needs. In this course, join Steven Lipton as he helps you get up to speed with the primary modules in Business One, including Sales, Purchasing, Banking, and Financials. Steven highlights the system’s benefits and limitations, shows how to customize modules and reports, and more. To lend these concepts a real-world context, he follows the story of a computer distributor using Business One with a customer, explaining how the company could customize their system.
