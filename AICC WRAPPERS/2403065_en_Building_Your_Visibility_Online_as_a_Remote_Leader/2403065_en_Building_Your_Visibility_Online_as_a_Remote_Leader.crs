[Course_Description]
Much of your day-to-day work likely requires you to interact with only a select few teams or colleagues. But as a leader, visibility is key to advancing your agenda. Your teams need to see you show up to lead and provide reassurance. And, as more organizations embrace a mixture of remote and onsite work, consistent communication from leadership is even more critical. In this course, learn how to intentionally manage and boost your visibility when working with remote teams. Communications and media expert Jessica Chen explains how to sketch out a remote visibility strategy that works, maintain a consistent messaging schedule, and build valuable relationships with senior leaders from afar. Jessica also goes over the different platforms and strategies you can use to boost your visibility, including how to stream virtual town halls and stay connected using recorded video messages.
