Professional vocalist Lari White breaks down how to harmonize with any music you like to sing, craft your vocal tone by employing vibrato and messa di voce, and work with the chest and head voice. She also gives you a crash course in working with microphones, and explains how to use the Nashville Number System to read and write music. Note: This course was recorded and produced by ArtistWorks.
