[Course_Description]
In Artist at Work, accomplished illustrator Von Glitschka takes members through the development of different types of illustrationsâ€”working from reference materials all the way to finished vector graphics. Join Von in this installment, as he looks at sample images of a Native American headdress, makes sketches, scans the final drawing into Adobe Illustrator, creates a vector work, and finishes the piece with color and shading.
