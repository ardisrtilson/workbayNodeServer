[Course_Description]
Learn how to use tests to drive the writing of your code, a key component of agile programming. More than just theory, this course covers a range of practical topics that can help Java developers get up and running with test-driven development (TDD). Instructor Matt Greencroft helps to acquaint you with the process that's required for TDD, as well as how to deal with real-world challenges you may encounter when carrying out TDD. Discover how to write your first test and determine what makes a good or bad test. Plus, learn how to test code where there's a dependency on third-party resources, how to create mocks and stubs with Mockito—a popular third-party library—and more.
