[Course_Description]
Many companies are bringing design in-house for greater creative control and cost efficiency. However, you may find the role of an in-house designer is very different from that of a freelancer. There is a stronger emphasis on templates and styles, consistent file output, and shared workflows. This course helps designers transition their Photoshop skills to in-house design work, with a focus on efficiency, compatibility, and collaboration. Designer and creative consultant Tony Harmer covers topics such as formatting Photoshop documents, making quick adjustments and selections, leveraging templates and presets, building libraries of assets and brushes, sharing your work, and finalizing files for export. Plus, get tips for generating assets for web and UX design, as well as print production, and creating animation and video in the Photoshop timeline.
