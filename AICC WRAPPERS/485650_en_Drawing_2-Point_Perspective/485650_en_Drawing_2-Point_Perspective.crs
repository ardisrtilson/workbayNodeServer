[Course_Description]
The principles of perspective allow artists to draw objects so they accurately reflect their height, width, depth, and position relative to one another. In one-point perspective, all lines converge to a single point on the horizon. Two-point perspective addresses the drawing issues we face rendering our subject from the side, where horizontal lines converge to two points on the horizon. Two-point perspective is a critical skill for drawing from life, and creating your own imaginary 3D worlds from scratch. Join artist Amy Wynne in this class as she demonstrates the basics of two-point perspective. After a brief demo of asymmetrical vs. symmetrical perspectives with 3D blocks, she takes us through more complex projects: an imagined street scene, complete with windows, doors, trees, and light posts, and an interior room with furniture. In chapter 5, Amy introduces strategies to strengthen your compositions by improving the illusion of depth. Practicing these techniques will breathe new life into your drawing and give you a new perspective on drawing.
