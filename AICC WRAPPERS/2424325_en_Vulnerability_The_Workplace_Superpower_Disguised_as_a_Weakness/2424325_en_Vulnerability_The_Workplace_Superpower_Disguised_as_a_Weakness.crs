[Course_Description]
No matter how much you may wish it so, you can't be amazing at everything. Enter the most misunderstood workplace superpower aroundâ€”vulnerability. Vulnerability is often seen as a weakness but, when presented courageously and confidently, it can be a powerful tool for success. In this audio-only course adapted from the Modern Mentor podcast, Rachel Cooke shows how to use vulnerability to propel yourself to personal and professional success. Rachel explains how vulnerability is presented in a work context and why showing vulnerability allows you to ask questions, try something and fail, and collaborate with others. She will include practical techniques to remain humble, gather collective wisdom, fearlessly address uncertainty, and comfortably accept the possibility of failure.
