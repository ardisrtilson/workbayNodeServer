[Course_Description]
3D visualization is a crucial aspect of 21st century product design, manufacturing, and marketing. This course illustrates a standard workflow for product viz, from importing a CAD model to rendering photorealistic imagery. It leverages the advanced tools of 3ds Max and the Arnold renderer to bring product designs to life in the production phases of scene layout, materials, lighting, and rendering. It also employs Adobe After Effects to composite and adjust render passes, giving you the ability to art-direct lighting without needing to re-render in 3D. The combination of 3ds Max and After Effects empowers artists and designers to render product visualizations with greater efficiency, flexibility, and creativity than ever before.
