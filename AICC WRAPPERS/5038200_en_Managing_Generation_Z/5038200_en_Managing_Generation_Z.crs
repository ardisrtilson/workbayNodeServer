Today’s managers understand the importance of bridging generation gaps—uniting traditionalists, baby boomers, Generation X, and millennials. But many fail to recognize that a new generation is here. Generation Z is significantly different than its predecessors: more realistic, competitive, and motivated. So how are managers going to adapt to the needs of these workers and future leaders? Join experts David Stillman and Jonah Stillman, a father and son team spanning Gen X and Gen Z, to learn what makes Gen Z unique as employees. Explore how Gen Z communicates, collaborates, receives feedback, and derives value from work. Using David and Jonah’s tips, you’ll be better prepared to recruit, retain, and manage this incredibly unique and diverse generation.
