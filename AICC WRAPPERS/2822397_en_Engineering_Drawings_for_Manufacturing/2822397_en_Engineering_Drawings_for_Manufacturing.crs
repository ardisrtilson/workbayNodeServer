[Course_Description]
Preparing clear, complete engineering drawings is a critical skill for nearly every design engineer. New engineers have traditionally had to learn drafting skills on the job, usually by trial and error. This course teaches the practical skills needed to independently prepare clear drawings that satisfy industry standards. For the learner, this course can increase marketability and reduce frustration during the first months of a new career. For the employer, this course can reduce the time required to train new engineers and decrease the potential for costly mistakes due to poor drawings. Join the engineering team from Tarkka for this hands-on look at creating engineering drawings for manufacturing, from preparing your template and selecting the right drawing type to choosing and placing views, specifying dimensions, and setting tolerances. By the end of this course, you'll have the skills to create clear, complete drawings that hold up to the most exacting standards. This course was created by Tarkka. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
