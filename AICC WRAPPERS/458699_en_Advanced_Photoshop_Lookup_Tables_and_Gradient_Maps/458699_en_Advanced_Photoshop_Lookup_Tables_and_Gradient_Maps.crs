[Course_Description]
Have you used lookup tables or gradient maps with Photoshop lately? Probably not. Most photographers aren't aware of them. But they're powerful tools for performing all manner of color correction and photo styling tasks. In this course, Rich Harrington demystifies lookup tables (LUTs) and shows how to use them with Photoshop, Lightroom, and other Adobe CC applications. He also shows how to use gradient maps—where tints are based on the luminance values in the image—to add creative color and noise to images, and how to organize, store, and share these assets with other Creative Cloud programs and other photo and video professionals.
