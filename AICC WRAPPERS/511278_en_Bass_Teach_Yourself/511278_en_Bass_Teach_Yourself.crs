Learn how to play the bass guitar. In this easy-to-follow course, guitar virtuoso Jared Meeker starts off with the basics; learn how to tune and hold your bass, familiarize yourself with the parts of the instrument, and get acquainted with tablature. As you progress through the course, Jared introduces you to different rhythms and keys, eventually moving on to more advanced concepts such as playing from chord sheets or tackling rock and roll licks from different eras.
