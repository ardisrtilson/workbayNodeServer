[Course_Description]
Following a user-centered design technique puts you more in touch with your users' true needs, which helps you develop solutions that really work for your intended audience. The approaches described in this course help development teams pool their diverse perspectives and collaborate to understand how to turn thoughts, feelings, frustrations, and desires of users into the design for a product. Join Chris Nodder as he provides a road map to his series,Â UX Design Techniques. Each technique in this series builds on the data and output from the previous techniques. The user data from observations is used to identify user pain points and create personas. The pain points and personas are used during the ideation phase to create multiple possible solutions. Scenarios and storyboards take these multiple possible solutions and narrow them down to a working set, from which you build a paper prototype that you can usability test with some more representative users. At any point, you can follow the trail all the way back to data you gathered from your initial observations.
