In this course, learn how to showcase marketing data in engaging ways. Veteran marketer Ian Lurie steps through how to create compelling data visualizations, providing tips that can help you craft clear, concise, and action-oriented marketing presentations. As Ian goes over good and bad examples of marketing reporting, he shares best practices for reducing mental tasks for your audience by removing redundant data ink, using color effectively, and finessing the typography in your presentation.
