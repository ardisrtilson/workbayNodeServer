[Course_Description]
We all know the expression of “saving face,” but what does it really mean, and how can you use the concept to benefit your negotiations? Mike Macchiarelli, a Sales Training and Business Development Trainer at KO Advantage Group, covers these questions and more in this audio-only course, adapted from the Negotiate Anything podcast. Mike explains in-depth what saving face is, including its mutual benefits and the difference between positive and negative face. He shows you where saving face is most crucial, then goes into two types of messaging and the correct uses of on-record versus off-record messages. After discussing how and why you can help others to save face, Mike concludes by describing how you can avoid being too nice. Note: This course was created by the American Negotiation Institute. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
