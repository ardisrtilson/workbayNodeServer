[Course_Description]
In this audio-only course, meditation expert Jack Kornfield teaches the heart-opening technique of loving-kindness meditation. As Jack illustrates, through using repeated phrases and mantras, you can mentally send goodwill, kindness, and warmth to others, planting the seeds of loving wishes that may then grow in yourself. Loving-kindness meditation can be part of your daily meditation time, but once you learn the techniques and become comfortable with the practice, it can be integrated into any part of your day as you move about.
