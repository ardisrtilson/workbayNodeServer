Crowdfunding allows you to find funding for films and other creative projects from people all over the world. But there are many types of crowdfunding, many platforms to choose, and many pitfalls that can trip up even the most well-deserving campaigns. Learn strategies to successfully plan, design, and execute your own crowdfunding campaign. Filmmaker Kelley Slagle leads you through best practices, shares practical advice and personal insights, and highlights success stories that will help you to meet your crowdfunding goals, whether you use Kickstarter, Indiegogo, or another platform. She covers topics like reaching your audience before the campaign even starts, making a campaign budget, designing a campaign video and visuals, choosing and creating rewards, and following through after your campaign ends.
