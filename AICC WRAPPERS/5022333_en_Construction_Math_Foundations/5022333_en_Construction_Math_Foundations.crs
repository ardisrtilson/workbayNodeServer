You may not have liked it in school, but math is essential for construction. In this course, you can learn the mathematics you need to succeed in a skilled tradeâ€”estimation, project management, or working in the field. Discover how to take measurements of objects, calculate volume and area, apply ratios, and convert units. And because weight is so important when transporting and supporting materials, instructor Jim Rogers teaches how to calculate weight based on size and determine the appropriate load for forklifts and cranes. The course is a practical and straightforward guide to the math construction professionals need to use the most. It provides clear examples and concise lessons, so you can get back to work and start crunching the numbers right away.
