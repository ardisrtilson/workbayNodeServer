[Course_Description]
For thousands of years, molds have been used to form raw materials like clay and metal into art, jewelry, and tools. With modern plastics, software, and manufacturing technologies, it's possible to cast almost any object from a mold. This course is an introduction to mold design in SOLIDWORKS, for everything from one-off prototyping to mass-manufacture of a variety of products. Learn best practices for getting repeatable, high-quality results with 3D printing and CNC machines. Design consultant and instructor Tam Black also provides an overview of the materials available for at-home and industrial-scale molding and casting, and helps you understand which production method is suitable for your scale of manufacture.
