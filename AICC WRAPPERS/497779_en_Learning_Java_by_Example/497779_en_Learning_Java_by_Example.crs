[Course_Description]
Do you learn best by doing? Why not learn Java that way? Learn Java Concepts by Example is a Java cookbook that pairs four Java programming challenges with step-by-step solutions. Julian Robichaux shows how to create command-line applications to search text and access a relational database, a GUI app to display and resize images, and a Java API to access third-party webpage content. By practicing these examples, you'll learn concepts such as regular expressions, arrays, JDBC, JAR files, Swing, Java math, lambdas, and RESTful programmingâ€”all within the context of real-world applications.
