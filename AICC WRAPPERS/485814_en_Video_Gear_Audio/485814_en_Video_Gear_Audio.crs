What's one of the best parts about being a video professional? All the cool gear! In this series, Rich Harrington and Robbie Carman team up to discuss the latest and greatest equipment for video production and post, including one of its most overlooked aspects: audio. Learn how to enhance the audio inputs on your camera, mobile device, or GoPro with smart and inexpensive adapters, and get the best sound from wireless mics. Discover accessories that will make your shoots run smoother—like a great pair of headphones—and how to record audio with a smartphone or tablet, laptop, or Tascam recorder. Plus, get an audio engineer's perspective on audio equipment from special guest Cheryl Ottenritter. As with the rest of the Video Gear series, Rich and Robbie keep both cost and quality in mind, so you'll never have to worry about blowing your budget or compromising production value.
