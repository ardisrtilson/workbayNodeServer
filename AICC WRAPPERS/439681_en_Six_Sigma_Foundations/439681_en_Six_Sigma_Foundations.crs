[Course_Description]
Learn how to apply Six Sigma to drive improvements in the performance of your processes, products, and services. Dr. Richard Chua explains the fundamentals of Six Sigma—a customer-focused, data-driven approach to improvement. He'll go over the basic concepts, including critical-to-quality (CTQ) requirements, variation, defects per million opportunities (DPMO), the roles and belts of Six Sigma professionals, and the criteria for identifying Six Sigma projects successfully. The rest of the course walks through the five phases of Six Sigma DMAIC—Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control—and the steps, data, and key deliverables involved in each phase.
