Explore perceived inter-generational differences and find out how to tap into the collaborative value of age diversity across an entire team. Join instructor John Tarnoff to learn how people born into distinct age cohorts can work together effectively, turning seemingly divergent attitudes and backgrounds into harmonious and productive working relationships. John busts some of the common myths about each generation, and provides playbooks and best practices to support managers and reports in working more effectively together. He also lists the action steps organizations can take to better support age diversity.
