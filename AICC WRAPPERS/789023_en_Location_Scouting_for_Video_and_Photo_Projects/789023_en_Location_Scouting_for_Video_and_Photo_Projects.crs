[Course_Description]
A great location is essential for your video production or photo shootâ€”you need the ideal setting to successfully tell your story. Yet the process of finding and securing a location can be challenging, and there are a lot of considerations beyond just finding a site. In this course, learn about the steps you need to take before you begin scouting, where to start your search, and how to conduct a site survey to ensure your location will be a success technically as well as visually. Plus, learn about the process of securing a site including permitting, acquiring location releases, and abiding local laws and restrictions. This course was created by RHED Pixel. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
