[Course_Description]
The use of artificial intelligence is fundamentally changing the way that photos are edited and enhanced. New creative options are unlocked and previously impossible tasks are made easy. Don’t wait to harness the power of artificial intelligence. Join instructor Rich Harrington as he explores a variety of AI-powered apps that can take your photography to the next level. Learn how to get better results from raw files, find images with intelligent search tools, and use software from Adobe, Skylum, EyeQ, and Topaz Labs to perform common and uncommon editing tasks, from fixing color and tone to automatically enhancing portraits to adding color and detail that doesn’t exist in the original photograph. By the end of the course, you’ll be amazed and empowered by what you can do with AI. This course was created by RHED Pixel. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
