[Course_Description]
Facial animation makes your character's inner life shine through. This course—focused on the principles, not the tools, of animation—explores how anatomy, expression, and emotion intertwine, and how animators can simulate emotion in the face of almost any character. George Maestri shows you how to animate three shots, of increasing complexity: a silent double take that transitions from one emotion to the next, a simple close-up dialogue shot, and a full-body dialogue shot that accounts for posture and secondary motion.
