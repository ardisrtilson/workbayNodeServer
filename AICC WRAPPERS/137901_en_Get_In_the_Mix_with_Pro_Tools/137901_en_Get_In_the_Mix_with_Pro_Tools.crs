[Course_Description]
Learn advanced Pro Tools mixing techniques, in a different way. The groundbreaking Get in the Mix learning experience allows you to watch Brian Lee White and Alex Case perform audio adjustments inside Pro Tools, while they explain their reasoning in the built-in video window. You don't watch in a video player; you learn inside the DAW itself. This course covers 26 techniques for improving your mixes with compressors, processors, EQ and filters, reverb, delay, and modulation. The first chapter covers compression and dynamics processing, including how to even out vocal performances and how to add punch to drum tracks. The second chapter goes into EQ and filtering techniques, such as creating complimentary EQ curves and EQ-ing FX returns. Next, the authors explore delay and modulation techniques, including using long delay on key lyrics and creating flanger and phaser effects. The last chapter explores reverb techniques including using gated reverb and supporting a track with regenerative reverb. .
