[Course_Description]
Customer service can mean many different things, but there are unifying principles across all customer-facing operations. Whether yours is a contact center, face-to-face retail, social media group handling service issues, or other type of organization, this course provides the practical know-how, real-life examples, and the direction you need to get the most out of your quality initiatives. Watch and learn how to establish quality standards in customer service, and improve loyalty, revenue, customer satisfaction, and employee engagement. Brad Cleveland divides the lessons into three chapters, covering quality and customer service definitions, quality standards for individuals, and quality standards for the overall organization. Along the way, he shows how to implement a process, measure progress, and effectively coach employees.
