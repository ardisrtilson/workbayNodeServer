[Course_Description]
When we want to communicate information that's meaningful to us, we usually tell a story. Human beings are storytelling animals. So if you want to communicate a message about your business, your product, or service via video, go the natural route: tell a story. In Storytelling for Business Video, Roger S.H. Schulman shows the tools and techniques authors and screenwriters can use to make any business video clearer, more compelling, and more persuasive. These tips work equally well whether you're trying to sell a product or service or to simply establish brand awareness. Roger examines the specific steps it takes to build an entertaining and memorable story, first looking at the various intersections between creative storytelling and marketing. Learn how to find the heroes (and maybe even the villains) of your story and use the three-act structure of Hollywood films to communicate the message of your business in a compelling way. Along the way, Roger builds a video script for a fictitious company step-by-step, and shows how storytelling techniques make the final script better in every way.
