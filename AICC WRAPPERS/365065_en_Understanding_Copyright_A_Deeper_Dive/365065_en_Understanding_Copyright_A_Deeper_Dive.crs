[Course_Description]
You've reviewed the basics of intellectual property. Now it's time for a deeper dive into copyrightâ€”your mechanism for protecting intellectual property that resides in a tangible form: books, songs, software, product designs, etc. Attorney Dana Robinson explains what constitutes copyright infringement, and how to respond when someone has infringed upon your copyright or if you receive a demand letter or cease and desist from a third party. He also explains licensing, public domain, and fair use, and reviews the process for searching for and filing copyrights. The course closes with a set of valuable copyright FAQs that address many of the most common questions about copyrighting intellectual property.
