[Course_Description]
Connecting a computer to your DSLR camera opens up a brand-new world of opportunities in image making. You can gain greater control over your in-camera adjustments and get a more accurate picture of your lighting and setup. In this course, Rich Harrington introduces the tethered shooting workflow and shows how to connect your camera to a computer, an external monitor, and even an iPad or mobile device. He'll review the shooting environment, building the tethered station, software solutions for tethering, and wireless shooting with a CamRanger or GoPro camera. Plus, get an in-depth look at seven different software solutions for tethering, including Lightroom, Canon's EOS Utility, Capture One Pro, and more. These techniques work well both in the studio and in the field, so you'll be prepared for all tethered shooting scenarios.
