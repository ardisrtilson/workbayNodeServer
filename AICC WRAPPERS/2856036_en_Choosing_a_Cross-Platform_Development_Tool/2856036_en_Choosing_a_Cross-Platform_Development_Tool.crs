[Course_Description]
Looking for the right cross-platform mobile development tool for your project? With so many options to choose from—each with its own set of pros and cons—picking a tool can sometimes feel more challenging than learning the platform itself. This course was designed to help you make the right call—whether you're a CTO or a developer. Join instructor Tom Duffy as he reviews five of the most popular cross-platform development frameworks: Cordova, React Native, Xamarin, Flutter, and Progressive Web Apps. Tom delves into the tools and technologies used in each of the five solutions, highlighting where each framework shines.
