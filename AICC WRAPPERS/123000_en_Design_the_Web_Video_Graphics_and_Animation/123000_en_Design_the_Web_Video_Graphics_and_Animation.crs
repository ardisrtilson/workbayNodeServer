Learn to edit video and add custom graphics and animations to your projectsâ€” all with Adobe Photoshop CS6 Extended! Author Chris Converse starts with the powerful new video editing tools in Photoshop CS6, which allow you to design and brand videos for your interactive and online projects. Once editing is complete, discover how to render the video as an MP4 file that can be uploaded to a favorite video website, incorporated into your own site, or embedded in an iBook, interactive PDF, or digital magazine. This course was created and produced by Chris Converse. We are honored to host this material in our library.
