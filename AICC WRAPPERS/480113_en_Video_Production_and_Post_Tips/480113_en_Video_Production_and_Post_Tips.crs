[Course_Description]
From the guys who brought you Video Gear Weekly comes Video Production and Post Tips. In this course, Rich Harrington and Robbie Carman answer common video production and post-production questions, explore gear, and demonstrate useful techniques. As you've come to expect, they keep both cost and quality in mind. Get practical. Get hands-on. Rich and Robbie explore the latest in video technologies, compatible gear, and how to adjust camera settings to capture images using new perspectives, new resolutions, and new speeds. They provide gear suggestions, with options that meet different budget ranges, and they demonstrate how to implement techniques to solve problems.
