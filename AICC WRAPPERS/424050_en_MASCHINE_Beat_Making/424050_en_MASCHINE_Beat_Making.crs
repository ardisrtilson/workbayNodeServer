[Course_Description]
MASCHINE is the go-to technology for making beats. This course is your go-to guide. Join producer and instructor JK Swopes as he demonstrates how to create beats using MASCHINE's built-in sounds, expansions, and samples. He covers basic rhythmic theory, and MASCHINE's main features for altering the sounds of a performance, including swing, quantization, and velocity. Next, he moves into making beats with the built-in sounds and official MASCHINE expansions, and creating melodies, drum parts, bass lines, and percussion tracks. He also demonstrates how to add variety to your patterns and arrange your patterns into a full song structure. In Chapter 3, JK uses the same techniques to make a new sample-based trackâ€”a great way to make custom sounds you won't hear anywhere else. Start watching to learn how to make your own beats with MASCHINE.
