[Course_Description]
Missing a knob, button, or drawer pull, or a piece from your favorite game? Learn how to reproduce missing pieces for 3D printing with Photoshop. Steve Caplin walks through two sample projects covering the major steps: producing the outline of the piece with a photograph or existing copy, extruding it in 3D space, and preparing it for print. Using an at-home 3D printer or a 3D printing service like Shapeways, you can reproduce a variety of buttons, game pieces, knobs, keys, and other small parts.
