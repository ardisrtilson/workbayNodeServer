[Course_Description]
Calligraphy is the source and root of all letterforms. Whether you're an aspiring type designer or lettering artist, or just someone who wants to write beautifully, this course provides you with a springboard to the study of any calligraphic hand. Follow Ina Saltz as she walks you through how to write the basic italic forms using a broad-edged pen. To begin, learn what materials you'll need and how to prepare your writing surface. Next, practice and progress through minuscules, or small letters, majuscules, or capital letters, numbers, and punctuation. Ina also touches on how to write with smaller nib sizes, add flourishes, and use color, as well as how lefties can best tackle calligraphy.
