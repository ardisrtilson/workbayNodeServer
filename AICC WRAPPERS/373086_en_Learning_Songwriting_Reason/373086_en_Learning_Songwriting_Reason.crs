[Course_Description]
Get your song ideas down before they disappearâ€š with Reason. In this short course, musician Matt Piper demonstrates two types of workflows for writing, recording, and mixing a song: one to get your demo ideas recorded fast, and another to polish your songs for presentation to partners, publishers, and record labels. He starts from an empty Reason project, recording a scratch track and finding the best tempo for the new song idea. Then he creates a beat, lays down additional tracks, and adds effects. Next Matt shows techniques for editing the tracks and mixing the tracks using effects like EQ, compression, reverb and delay. Finally, he shows how to bounce down the track and share it with the world.
