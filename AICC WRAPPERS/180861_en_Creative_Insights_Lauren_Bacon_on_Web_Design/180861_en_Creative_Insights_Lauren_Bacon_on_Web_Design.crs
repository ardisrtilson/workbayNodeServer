[Course_Description]
Lauren Bacon ran a successful web design and development firm for twelve years. Now she is working as a business coach, helping entrepreneurs get their own businesses up and running. In this course, she shares her insights on breaking into the industry: acquiring the right skills, thinking beyond the digital toolset, and specializing in areas that will make your firm in demand. Lauren also answers questions about navigating career transitions, from employee to manager, to freelancer (and maybe even back again), and what the future will look like for new web designers.
