[Course_Description]
Motionographer is more than a website. It's a curatorial space, and a community for motion graphics artists, animators, and filmmakers around the world. In this documentary, we profile founder Justin Cone, who decided to shine a spotlight on motion graphics at a time when digital design wasn't given its due. Along with his right-hand man and work husband Carlos El Asmar, Justin has built Motionographer into a community-centered site that doesn't just focus on the latest studio reels, but on the issues that are most compelling to the careers of working artists. Learn how Justin, a writer turned self-taught designer, overcame criticism and a lingering imposter syndrome to build Motionographer into the beacon it is for motion designers today.
