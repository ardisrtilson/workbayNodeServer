[Course_Description]
See the benefits of learning to photograph wildlife in a controlled environment, and learn how to evoke emotion and personality in the animals you photograph. In this course, photojournalist Paul Taggart takes us to B. Bryan Preserve on the picturesque Northern California coast to study the wildlife there. Local preserves like B. Bryan are a great way to practice your skills before going on safari or to other exotic locations. He explains how to scout spaces, choose and handle gear for photographing wildlife, overcome various challenges (such as shooting around fencing), and stay safe while photographing wild animals. In the final chapter, Paul reviews his best shots of the preserve's famous giraffes, zebras, and sable antelopes.
