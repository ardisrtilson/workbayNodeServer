[Course_Description]
The work of developers doesn’t stop when code is committed. You need to help others understand the value of what you do—and why. This course examines the barriers between technological concepts and nontechnical audiences and proposes ways to overcome them. It identifies four major kinds: barriers of experience, motivation, perspective, and style. Instructor and communicator Tom Geller explains how to recognize these barriers and adapt your message to meet your audiences in the middle. He also examines specific opportunities to put your new skills into practice: with clients, vendors, team members, partners, conference audiences, and members of the public. The skills you learn in this course can benefit your career and your daily life. Discover how to overcome differences, strengthen your relationships, and promote your work by communicating in a way that everyone can understand.
