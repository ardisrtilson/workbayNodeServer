By leveraging lean principles in your organization, you can cut down on waste, improve quality, and enhance your business processes. In this course, discover how to apply lean principles to one of the most crucial of these processes—inventory management. Instructor Steven Brown begins by discussing how inventory fits into the seven wastes of lean, as well as how to forecast inventory for lean. He then goes over lean tools—including 5S and Kanban—and discusses lean tactics that can help you build and deliver high-quality products on time. To wrap up, he highlights lean strategies that can help you manage supplier inventories and inventory buffers, continuously improve, and make lean inventory management part of your company culture.
