[Course_Description]
A common photo restoration task involves replacing the background in an old photoâ€”for example, to turn a snapshot into something that looks more like a studio portrait. In this course, master restorationist Neil Rhodes shows how to accomplish tasks like these using Photoshop. He covers the entire process: evaluating the photo, choosing an appropriate replacement background, using Photoshop's selection features to create a precise mask, and then inserting the new background and matching the grain of the original.
