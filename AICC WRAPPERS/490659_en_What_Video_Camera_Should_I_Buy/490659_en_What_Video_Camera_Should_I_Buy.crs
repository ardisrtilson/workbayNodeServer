[Course_Description]
Video cameras have come a long way. They're smaller, lighter, and shoot in higher resolutions—4K and beyond. Now more than ever, we have to make the right choice on what camera to buy or rent for the type of productions we shoot. The lighting, the locations, the size of your team, and even the computer you use for video editing can all impact the decision. Evaluating your production workflow and the camera options out there can save you time, money, and maybe even your sanity. Camera enthusiast Erik Naso is here to help. He'll teach you how to ask the right questions and pick the right camera—balancing the camera I should buy with the camera I want to buy, so you end up happy with your purchase over the long run. Learn how to figure out your budget and needs; understand the different file formats, sensors, and lenses available; and choose the right accessories for any shooting situation.
