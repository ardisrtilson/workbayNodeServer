[Course_Description]
InDesign Typography explores the numerous type options, type-related features, and type-specific preferences of Adobe InDesign. Using practical, real-world examples, instructor and designer Nigel French explains the purpose of each feature and describes the conventions for how and when to use it. Part 1 focuses on micro typography or the appearance of individual letterforms. Nigel dissects the anatomy of a typeface and defines the terminology used to describe type in graphic design. He moves into choosing a typeface, scaling type, and adjusting spacing via InDesign's leading and kerning controls. The course closes with a look at glyphs, special characters, and OpenType features, including ligatures and fractions.
