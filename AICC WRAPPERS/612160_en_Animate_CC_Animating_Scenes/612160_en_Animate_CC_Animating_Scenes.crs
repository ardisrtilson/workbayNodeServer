[Course_Description]
After you've created a storyboard for your animated project, you're ready to tackle the next phase of the pipelineâ€”actually assembling your scenes and rigging your characters. In this course, learn how to use Adobe Animate CC to assemble and animate a scene, and set up a complex rig for both a human character and a robot. Dermot O'Connor shows how to properly line a character, place the pivots, and set up the scene symbol. Plus, he shows how to animate a dynamic action scene, import audio, and export your scene.
