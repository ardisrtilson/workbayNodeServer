[Course_Description]
Productions, a Premiere Pro feature set launched in April 2020, was designed to help editors easily organize large projects and collaborate with others. Each Production functions as a folder in which you can put project files that act as bins. Whether you're collaborating with a team of other editors or managing a complex workflow as a solo editor, Productions can help you work faster and smarter. In this course, learn how to efficiently manage and collaborate on media and projects in Adobe Premiere Pro using Productions. Instructor Luisa Winters explains what Productions are, outlines the benefits you can get from using Productions, and explains how to set up and build a Production. Plus, learn how to work with clips in a Production, use a decentralized collaboration workflow, and more.
