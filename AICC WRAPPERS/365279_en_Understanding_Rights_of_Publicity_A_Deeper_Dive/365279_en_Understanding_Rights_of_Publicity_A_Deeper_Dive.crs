[Course_Description]
In the US, everyone has rights over their own identity. No one can profit off your name or likeness without permission. But laws vary state to state, and so does what happens when rights of publicity (ROP) are licensed or infringed upon. This course answers the critical questions. What is ROP? What is the difference between ROP and copyright or trademark? How do you get ROP clearance or release? What is the length of time granted for an ROP release? How do you transfer ROP? And what constitutes fair use? Intellectual property lawyer Dana Robinson guides viewers through these complex questions and more. He also addresses what constitutes infringement and discusses recent cases on rights of publicity and the first amendment, covering issues such as using a domain name, username, hashtag, or other indicia of association with someone's name.
