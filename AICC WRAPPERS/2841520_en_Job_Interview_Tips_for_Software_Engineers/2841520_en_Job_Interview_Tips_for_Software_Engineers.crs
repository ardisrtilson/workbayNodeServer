[Course_Description]
Many engineers master difficult skills but still struggle with some commonly asked questions. In this course, instructor Nishant Bhajaria walks you through ten of the questions most commonly asked in job interviews. For each question, he explains how you should approach the question, then offers an example answer and feedback. With questions ranging from why you want to work for a company to what you think an ideal product-engineering relationship should look like, Nishant offers solid ways to prepare for job interviews.
