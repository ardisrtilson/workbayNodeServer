[Course_Description]
Whether you work in sales or customer service, you need a way to track your sales activity, relationships, and contacts. Microsoft Access is a powerful relational database program that can help you do all that and more. In this course, Laurie Ulrich shows you the ins and outs building a customized database solution, designed for the way you go about selling. If you don't have a satisfactory customer relationship management (CRM) application, you'll appreciate the power Access puts literally at your fingertips to design a completely customized tool. The sales solution database you design—with Laurie's help and examples—will allow you to build and store customer data, look up customer orders, and generate reports such as product price lists and order totals. Along the way, you can learn more intermediate and advanced Access features, such as validation rules, lookup tables, and macros. Plus, learn how to build a navigation form that puts key forms and reports in a single, easy-to-access location.
