[Course_Description]
This course introduces the many advanced features of the CINEMA 4D rendering and lighting toolsets. Discover how to better simulate real-world surfaces, photography, and lighting scenarios. Author Donovan Keith shows how to add realistic shallow depth-of-field effects with the physical renderer, use blurry reflections to create a type treatment, and light scenes with HDRI photographs and global illumination. Plus, learn tricks for achieving similar effects under tight deadlines.
