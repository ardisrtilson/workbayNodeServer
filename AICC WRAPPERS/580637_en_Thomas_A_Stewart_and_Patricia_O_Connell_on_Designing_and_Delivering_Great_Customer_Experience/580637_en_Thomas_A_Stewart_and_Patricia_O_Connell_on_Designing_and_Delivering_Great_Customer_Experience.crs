[Course_Description]
In this course, join thought leaders Thomas Stewart and Patricia O'Connell as they share their novel approach to service design, and explain why providing a great customer experience must be a strategic choice that's woven into the fabric of your businessâ€”not slapped on at the end. Thomas and Patricia discuss what great service design can do for your organization, and how to identify and win at make-or-break moments in customer interaction. They also share how to enhance brand consistency by ensuring that customers get the same quality of service across your organization. To wrap up, they help you evaluate your own service design GPA (grade point average), and take your service design ideas from the drawing room to the board room.
