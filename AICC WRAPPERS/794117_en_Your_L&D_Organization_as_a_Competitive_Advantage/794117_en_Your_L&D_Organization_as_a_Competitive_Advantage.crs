[Course_Description]
Learning and development (L&D) helps improve productivity, customer experience, and a business's bottom line. But many L&D professionals don't feel like they are part of their organization's success. To earn the support of executives and increase employee participation, you need to promote the value of trainingâ€”positioning L&D as a competitive advantage and aligning with your organization's strategic goals. In this course, instructor Karl Kapp shows how to communicate the value of a strong L&D department, assess the maturity of your program, and align your learning goals with business strategy. Plus, learn how to measure the success of your L&D program against key learning metrics and business outcomes.
