[Course_Description]
CINEMA 4D R18 Essentials: Motion Graphics introduces artists to the CINEMA 4D workflow. Learn the key foundational concepts, such as spline modeling, keyframe animation, and materials, which are crucial to understanding exactly how this 3D application functions. Instructor Andy Needham also includes practical techniques for creating, selecting, and transforming objects; extruding shapes; working with MoGraph module tools such as clones and effectors; and adding lighting and camera views for fully realized 3D motion graphics. Plus, find out how to integrate assets from Adobe Illustrator, composite multipass renders with the After Effects and C4D workflow, and use the Takes System to try out different materials and settings and export your projects in the exact sizes and resolutions you need.
