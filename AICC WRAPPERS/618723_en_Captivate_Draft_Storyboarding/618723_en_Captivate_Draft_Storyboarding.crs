[Course_Description]
Adobe Captivate Draft allows you to create elearning storyboards on your iPad, and then export them into Captivate to quickly start building an elearning project. In this brief course, follow along with Oliver Schinkten as he explores storyboarding best practices while demonstrating how to use Draft. He walks through how to create a new project; add content to your slides; and make your storyboard more interactive by adding question slides and hotspots that—when selected—bring users back to a specific slide in the deck. Plus, he goes into how to send a project for review, view feedback, and export or import a project from Captivate.
