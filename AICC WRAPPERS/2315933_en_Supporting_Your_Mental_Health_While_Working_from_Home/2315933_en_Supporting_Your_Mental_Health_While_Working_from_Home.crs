Working from home is a new phenomenon for many professionals. Different worlds—work, school, and parenting—are suddenly colliding. People are discovering how much their environment impacts their productivity and wellbeing, and how difficult it can be to focus when there are so many demands on their time. In this course, neuroscience expert and author Amy Brann helps you adjust to this new normal by training your brain to overcome disruptions and distractions, accept and get real about your emotions, reframe your expectations, and preserve your relationships. Using the latest insights from neuroscience, Amy shares nontechnical, practical guidance for not just surviving, but thriving as you work from home.
