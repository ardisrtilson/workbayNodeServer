[Course_Description]
As a leader, your team and organization rely on you to have good judgement and make the right decision with the information you have. Good decisions are the product of strong critical thinking skills and thoughtful problem solving. And like all skills, you can learn, practice, and get better at them. In this course, Dr. Eric Zackrison helps you do just that. He shows how to critically assess the source of information and how to determine the right approach to take. Eric also demonstrates strategies for approaching both simple and complex problems, and details taking your team through the entire life cycle of a challenging decision. He also imparts an understanding of common traps people fall into when solving problems, both individually and as a team. After this course, youâ€™ll have the tools to approach your next problem more critically and solve it more effectively. This course was created by Madecraft.
