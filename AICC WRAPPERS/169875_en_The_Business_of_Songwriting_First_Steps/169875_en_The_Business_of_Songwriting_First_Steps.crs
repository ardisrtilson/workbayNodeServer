[Course_Description]
When it comes to making money in songwriting, writing great songs is only part of the equation. In this course, author Garrick Chow introduces you to all of the major organizations, rights, and procedures that songwriters have to deal with in the music business. First, he'll start with understanding performance and mechanical rights, covering topics such as split letters, copyright, performance rights organizations (PROs) like ASCAP and SESAC, SoundExchange, Harry Fox, master recording licenses, and synch licenses. The second half of the course is geared toward the DIY musician. Garrick discusses ways to self-distribute and promote your music with TuneCore, CDBaby, Topspin, Bandcamp, and ReverbNation. Plus, learn the importance of websites, social promotion, and music placement, as well as making music videos, signing with a record label, and building a solid team.
