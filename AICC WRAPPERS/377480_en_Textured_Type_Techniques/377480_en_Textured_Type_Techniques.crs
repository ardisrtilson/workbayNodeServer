[Course_Description]
Take a break from the computer. Learn how to create type with your hands. LA-based creative director Todd Gallopo introduces three analog techniques for manipulating type that can't be achieved in exactly the same way digitally. Todd shows how to create hand-cut type, transfer-textured type, and type with a chalky or hand-drawn look. He'll also reveal the best ways to convert your handmade type into vector forms that can be used in design applications such as Photoshop and Illustrator. For the best results, we suggests assembling the materials you'll need for each project beforehand: X-Acto knives, scotch tape and paper tape, blender pens, tissue paper, and a variety of pencils.
