[Course_Description]
In this course, Pulitzer finalist Natalie Fobes shows how to capture engaging portrait shots of couples, families, and other groups using a variety of posing and composition techniques. Learn how to plan for a portrait photo shoot and how to make stylistic decisions regarding props, clothing, and makeup. Next, explore the essentials of posing women and men, starting with a single subject and working up to large groups. The course demonstrates how to pose and compose a group portrait in ways that highlight the relationships between members. To illustrate the time constraints photographers often face, Natalie works against the clock to shoot a group of people she's never met. She also covers post-processing techniques for portraiture, such as working with wrinkles and skin textures.
