Each time you go online, you face the threat of malware. In this course, learn how to find and analyze malware that's undetected by most antivirus programs. Follow Thomas Pantels as he shows how to work with the Windows Performance Recorder—which is used to record system events—and the Windows Performance Analyzer, which is used to inspect those events. He explains how to find and analyze key logger patterns and then shows how to analyze screen recordings, webcam recordings, and microphone recordings.
