[Course_Description]
New parents want photographs of their kids every step of the wayâ€”including all their first moments. Family photographer Lauren Enright shows how to plan, scout, and shoot beautiful photographs of new families. Learn techniques for taking portraits that capture a newborn's personality, and find out how to use backdrops in different areas of the home, capture spontaneous moments, and create your own DIY-backdrops for studio-like portraits. Note: Lauren brings a portable studio setup to supplement the more casual lifestyle shots, but you can use these tips to capture great newborn photos with any camera and good natural light.
