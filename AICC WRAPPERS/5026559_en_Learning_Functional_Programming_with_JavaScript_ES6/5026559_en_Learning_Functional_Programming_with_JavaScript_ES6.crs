[Course_Description]
Want to write more robust, maintainable code? In this course, discover how this can be accomplished with functional programming, and learn about the functional concepts at the heart of many JavaScript frameworks and programs. Shaun Wassell begins by explaining what functional programming is and how it compares to object-oriented programming. Shaun then covers the basics of working with first-class functions in JavaScript ES6+, discussing concepts such as higher-order functions and closure. He also shows how functional programming makes working with data structures more straightforward; dives into advanced concepts, including partial application and recursion; and provides challenges that can help you test your understanding of key functional programming concepts.
