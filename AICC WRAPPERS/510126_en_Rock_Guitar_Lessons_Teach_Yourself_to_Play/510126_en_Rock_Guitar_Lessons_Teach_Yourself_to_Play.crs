[Course_Description]
Rock Guitar: Teach Yourself to Play provides a completely new approach to learning guitar, for students who want to play in the rock style. By starting on the 6th string, you are immediately able to play riffs and licks—the kind of progress that inspires you to continue learning. The videos feature clear well-paced instruction along with close-up examples of fingering and strumming. Find out how to hold your guitar, read music and tablature, play simple and advanced chords, and play different strings and notes together. Instructor and guitar virtuoso Jared Meeker also demos some popular rock and blues licks and tricks, and introduces the E minor and A minor pentatonic scales—5-note scales that are critical to playing rock guitar. Learning guitar has never been easier or more fun. This course is a great choice for today's beginning guitar students.
