[Course_Description]
If you run a business, you probably want your business to have as broad a market as possible, which means, ideally, conducting business in multiple countries. Of course, having a business that’s active in a global, interconnected economy brings with it a whole slew of accounting challenges. How do you keep track of credits and debits when you’re dealing with US dollars, euros, British pounds, Japanese yen, and more? In this course, accounting experts Jim Stice and Kay Stice dive into how conducting business across national borders creates finance and accounting challenges that don’t exist when all business is done locally. Lenders, investors, and borrowers need to communicate using a common financial language. Jim and Kay show how additional operating, investing, financing, legal, and social risks are introduced when a company buys, sells, borrows, or invests across national borders.
