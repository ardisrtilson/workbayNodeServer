[Course_Description]
Design differently with Fusion 360. This cloud-powered tool from Autodesk is the key to instant 3D creativity, used for product design, mechanical engineering, and fabrication. This essential training gives you the expertise to use Fusion 360 to turn your ideas into ready-to-manufacture designs that flow to 3D printing, CNC milling, or injection molding. Instructor Nick Kloski, founder of HoneyPoint3D, provides an overview of all the basic operations in Fusion 360, including sketching, extruding 3D objects, sculpting, and surface modeling. He explains the functions of the software, while providing a solid foundation in the basics of effective 3D design. Learn how to plan a project; model your ideas; work with sketches, meshes, and surfaces; generate files for 3D printing; and analyze your designs. Plus, learn how to create photorealistic renderings and even animations of your Fusion 360 designs. Note: This course was created and produced by HoneyPoint3D. We are honored to host this training in our library.
