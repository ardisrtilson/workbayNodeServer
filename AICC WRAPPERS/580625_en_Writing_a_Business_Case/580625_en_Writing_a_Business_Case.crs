[Course_Description]
You have a great idea you believe will improve your business. In order to make your idea a reality, you may be asked to write a business case that clearly articulates what you want to accomplish, how you're going to do it, and why it's worth doing. Business cases are traditionally used in approval and prioritization processes. They can also be used to measure the results of an initiative. In this course, join Mike Figliuolo as he explains step-by-step how to craft a compelling business case for your stakeholders. Mike covers how to define the problem your plan addresses, communicate your idea's benefits, build the financial projections to support your case, create a robust risk assessment, and more.
