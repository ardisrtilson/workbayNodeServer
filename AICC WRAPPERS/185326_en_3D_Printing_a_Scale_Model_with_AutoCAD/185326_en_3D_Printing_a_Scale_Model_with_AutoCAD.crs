[Course_Description]
By 3D printing scale models, architects can save time, troubleshoot problems, and fully illustrate their ideas in three dimensions. In this course, Kacie Hultgren takes you through the steps of transforming your 2D architectural drawings into a 3D model printed on a MakerBot 3D printer. The course reviews AutoCAD's 3D modeling tools and commands, and pays special attention to necessary adaptations and settings for successful 3D prints.
