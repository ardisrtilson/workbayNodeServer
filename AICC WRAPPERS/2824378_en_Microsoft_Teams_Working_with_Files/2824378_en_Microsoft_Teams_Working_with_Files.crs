Microsoft Teams is changing the way we work. With Teams, you can share files in a one-on-one chat, during a Teams meeting, or by posting to a departmentâ€™s Teams channel. Although many users are sharing and storing files with Teams, they may not know the best way to find previously shared files or how to manage file permissions. In this course, LinkedIn Staff instructor Nick Brazzi highlights the best ways to store, organize, edit, and share files using Microsoft Teams. Nick begins with a quick overview of how file sharing works in Teams. He then demonstrates how to view and edit files, including how to set and adjust file permissions. Nick shows how to manage your file libraries within Teams to ensure contents are organized efficiently. He also covers the most effective way to share your screen during a Teams meeting, showing techniques for PowerPoint presentations and other file types. To wrap up, Nick offers tips for managing files in the Teams mobile app.
