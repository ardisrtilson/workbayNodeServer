[Course_Description]
Adobe Draw is made for illustration on the goâ€”drawing anywhere inspiration strikes. Here Von Glitschka shares his favorite uses for this iOS and Android app. New and seasoned artists alike will benefit from watching over Von's shoulder to see how he transitions a hand-drawn sketch to the iPad and adds details and color with Adobe Draw. Follow along for a tour of Adobe Draw's best features and get techniques for refining line work, coloring a sketch, drawing, and adding shadows and highlights. At the end of the course, Von shows how to create new brushes and textures with Adobe Capture and then shifts his illustrations to the desktop to capitalize on the full-fledged power of Illustrator and Photoshop CC.
