[Course_Description]
Families are an integral part of working in Revit, and the key to creating custom content. They group similar elements with shared parameters (such as walls or windows)â€”and while there are predefined families available in Revit, creating your own families is a great way to build a library of custom content. This course will teach you the ins and outs of family creation in Revit 2016. Following an overview of the basics, Eric provides specific instructions on modeling different types of families: foundation, framing, annotation, and truss families. He'll show how to perform 3D extrusions and build in flexibility with parameters, as well as create formulas, array parameters, and lookup tables.
