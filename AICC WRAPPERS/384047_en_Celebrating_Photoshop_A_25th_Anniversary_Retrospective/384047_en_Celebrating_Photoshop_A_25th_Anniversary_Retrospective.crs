[Course_Description]
For over two decades, Photoshop has been an essential part of the digital artist's toolset. To celebrate its 25th anniversary, we've taken a look back at Photoshop's history: from the rise of desktop publishing and digital photography, to the evolution of Photoshop's tool palette and its sometimes controversial but necessary role in modern photojournalism. We interview early adopters and pioneering artists such as Bert Monroy, Chris Orwig, and Douglas Kirkland, as well as the people responsible for guiding Photoshop's development: John Nack, Russell Brown, and current product manager Bryan O'Neil Hughes. Konrad Eek and Sean Adams also explain what life was like before Photoshop and how this beguiling tool has democratized design and darkroom photography. Also featuring: David Blatner Anne Marie Concepci√≥n John Curley Richard Koci Hernandez Katrin Eismann Nigel French Von Glitschka Jan Kabili Ben Long Deke McClelland Justin Seeley Ami Vitale James Williamson
