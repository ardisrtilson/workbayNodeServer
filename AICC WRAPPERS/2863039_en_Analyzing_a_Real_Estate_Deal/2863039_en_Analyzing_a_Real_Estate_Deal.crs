[Course_Description]
Your success in real estate is not going to come from having lots of experience, credibility, cash, or even good people skills. It comes from knowing how to buy the right piece of real estate at the right price. So before you buy your first (or next) investment property, you need to understand precisely: how much to buy the property for, how much to sell the property for, and how much profit you're going to make as a result. When you know these numbers, it makes real estate investing a lot less risky. This course explains how to run the numbers on any property and know if you've got a deal. Learn how to analyze a lead on your phone, on your desktop, or in person; calculate the after-repair value; conduct more research via the MLS; look for market anomalies; and prepare to view homes in person and make smart deals. This course was created by WealthFit. We are pleased to host this content in our library.
