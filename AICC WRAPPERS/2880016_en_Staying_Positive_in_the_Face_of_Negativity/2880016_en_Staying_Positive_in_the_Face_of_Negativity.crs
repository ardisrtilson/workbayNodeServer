[Course_Description]
Even the most optimistic of us can get weighed down when seemingly unrelenting negativity swirls around us at work and in life. It impacts our perspective, presence, and performance. Self-leadership expert Scott Mautz teaches a specific plan for fostering sustainable positivity, especially in the face of tiresome negativity. You’ll be able to stay positive over the long haul by applying fundamentals of positivity—like staying grounded and practicing a special type of gratitude—and by drawing optimism from increased mental strength. Learn to build specialized positivity skills—such as handling criticism and difficult people—and build daily habits of positivity too. Plus, hear real-world examples and craft a personal MAP (micro action plan) for being realistic but staying upbeat when it feels like the world is conspiring to keep you down.
