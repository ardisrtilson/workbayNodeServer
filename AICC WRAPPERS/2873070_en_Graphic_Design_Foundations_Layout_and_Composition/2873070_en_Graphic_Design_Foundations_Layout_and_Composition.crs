[Course_Description]
Layout and composition are the building blocks of graphic design. A strong composition will attract attention, clarify understanding, and engage the viewer whether the project is a print- or screen-based project, a still or motion graphic, a 3D or 2D graphic. This course explains the elements, principles, and tools you will need to create a successful composition and layout. Author Sean Adams explains the elements of layout (from shapes to space), how to use principles such as scale and hierarchy, and teaches how tools like grids, proportions, and color can lead to more compelling compositions.
