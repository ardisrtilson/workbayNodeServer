[Course_Description]
Motion graphics and animation can take a long time to develop—so it's important to get ideas locked down before moving into the production stages. Storyboards are key. They can be used as a communication tool between all members of the production team, including the client. They help others visualize your ideas and avoid misinterpretation—making sure everyone is on the same page. In this course you can learn some great tips for building storyboards and animatics with the tools in Adobe Creative Cloud. Learn how to quickly capture your ideas with the Adobe iOS drawing and sketching tools. Can't draw? Learn ways of creating storyboards with found images using Photoshop. Once you've created your storyboard, find out how record voiceovers in Premiere Pro, work out the timing, add basic transformations and effects before using Dynamic Link to incorporate After Effects and Cinema 4D into your development process. Finally, Angie shows how to share and review your work online so that everyone is agreed on the final product.
