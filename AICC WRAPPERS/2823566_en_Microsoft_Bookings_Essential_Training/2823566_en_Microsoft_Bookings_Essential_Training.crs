[Course_Description]
Microsoft Bookings allows your customers to schedule appointments with you without the need for a phone call or email contact. Bookings also provides support for managing your appointments, such as handling cancellations and rescheduling, sending appointment confirmations and reminders, and automatically updating your staff’s calendars. While Bookings is included with Microsoft 365 (formerly known as Office 365), your customers don’t need to be 365 subscribers themselves in order to book appointments with you. This course covers everything you need to begin booking appointments with ease. Instructor David Rivers begins by walking through how to set up your business offerings and public calendar. David then shows how to create and manage your customer and staff lists, set scheduling policies, and assign staff to open appointment dates and times. He also covers how to manage your bookings from a mobile device.
