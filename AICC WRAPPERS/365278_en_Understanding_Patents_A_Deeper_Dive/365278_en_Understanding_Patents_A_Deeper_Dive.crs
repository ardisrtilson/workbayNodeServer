Want to patent your invention or technologyâ€”or avoid infringing on someone else's? Learn the defining characteristics of successful patents, including what is and is not patentable and the types of patents available. Lawyer Dana Robinson shows how to distinguish between good ideas that can be patented as well as good ideas that don't meet the strict requirements of patent law. He also outlines the process and timeline of the patent application process and explains how businesses can avoid infringing on existing patents with a simple search.
