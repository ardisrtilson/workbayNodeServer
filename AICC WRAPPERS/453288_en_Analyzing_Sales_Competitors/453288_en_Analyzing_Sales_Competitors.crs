[Course_Description]
There is more to keeping an eye on your competitors than just knowing their products and features. What is their messaging like? What value are they adding? What are their unique differentiators? In this course, Jeff Bloomfield helps you analyze your sales competition. It starts with understanding your buyer's point of view, and then being honest when making comparisons. Jeff shows how tools like LinkedIn and Google Alerts can help you stay up to date on your competition's personnel and product updates, and how you can take advantage of the webinars, presentations, and other resources presented by your competition. Last, while competitor information is critical, it's ultimately more important for you to remember the value that your company brings. Jeff closes by explaining how you can best sell your company's products and services: by not getting too distracted by the competition.
