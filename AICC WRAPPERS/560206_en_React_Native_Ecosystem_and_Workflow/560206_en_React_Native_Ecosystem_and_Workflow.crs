[Course_Description]
React Native makes it easy to develop applications and then deploy them natively to multiple mobile platforms. That said, building a complete app means looking beyond React Native to the different options that can help you customize your workflow. In this course, Emmanuel Henri takes you on a tour of some of the most commonly used React Native features. To begin, he shines a spotlight on some of the React Native UI libraries. Next, he reviews development resources and shows a few different backend options for your project. To wrap up, he provides an overview of the different testing and deployment options available to you.
