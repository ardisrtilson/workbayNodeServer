Making your own website may be easier than ever before, with the amount of services, sites, and tools at your disposal, but all those options and choices may lead to decision paralysis. What domain do you pick? What hosting service do you use? How do you design the site to match your brand? Let longtime LinkedIn Learning instructor Jen Kramer show you the way. In this course, Jen covers the important decisions to be made in the no-code website realm, from the first decisions, to building the site, to maintaining the site after creation. She covers factors to consider when making personal aesthetic choices such as fonts, tone, and imagery, as well as technical aspects like choosing a platform, optimizing images for the web, and improving website performance. If you have an idea or brand you want to promote with a website, this course will give you the tools to help you get up and running.
