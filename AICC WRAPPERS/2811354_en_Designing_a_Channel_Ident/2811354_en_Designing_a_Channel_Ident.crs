[Course_Description]
Idents are short promo videos that identify a station or network. Once a mainstay of radio and television, idents are now a critical branding element for all digital channels, especially platforms like YouTube. Join Eran Stern in this short, fun, and easy course, where he shows how to create your own ident in After Effects. Learn how to import and animate a multi-layered Illustrator file using the Graph Editor, extrude a logo into 3D, add 3D particles and animated text, and apply sophisticated lighting and shadows. Eran also shows how to render your result to a master file for delivery.
