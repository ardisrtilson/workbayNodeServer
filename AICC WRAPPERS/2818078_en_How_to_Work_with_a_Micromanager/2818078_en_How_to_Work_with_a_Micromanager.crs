Micromanagers—managers that are prone to excessive supervision and control—can be really demoralizing. The good news is while you can’t change your manager, you can build a healthy and more sustainable relationship that makes it feel like you’re both on the same team. Join career coach Jena Viviano, as she shares some helpful tips for understanding and communicating with micromanagers. First, learn how to identify the behaviors of a micromanager—in your boss or even in yourself. Then learn tactics that put the micromanager at ease, including effectively processing feedback, building trust, and anticipating concerns before they arise. Finally, discover conflict resolution tactics that will help you implement change and feel more confident about your abilities and your job.
