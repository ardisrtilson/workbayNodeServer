Customer service calls can sometimes get out of control. Upset and overtalkative callers take time and energy away from other customers and tasks. This is where practical call-control strategies come into play. Join customer service trainer Myra Golden as she explains the reasons customer calls get out of hand, and introduces simple strategies to get you back in control. Learn how use a limited response, take control with close-ended questions, assert your way out of a bad conversation, and practice proactive call management so customers feel heard. Youâ€™ll leave the course with a variety of actionable tips to turn long, problematic phone calls into polite and efficient interactions.
