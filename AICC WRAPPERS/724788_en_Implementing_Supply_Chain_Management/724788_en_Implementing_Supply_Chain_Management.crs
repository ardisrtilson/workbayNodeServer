Daniel goes over the different supply chain processes that must be managed in an integrated way: plan, source, make, deliver, return, and enable. He uses this process view to describe the key challenges that supply chain managers need to address, the notable trends that are forcing supply chains to evolve, and a five-step process for helping your company implement supply chain management effectively.
