Learn how to set up quick, easy, and automatic JavaScript testing using Cypress.io. Cypress is a cutting-edge testing framework that makes testing JavaScript applications more frictionless. This training course is a rapid introduction to Cypress.io, covering basic and intermediate techniques for writing end-to-end test cases. Learn how to write a simple test, and then use aliases to optimize selections and beforeEach hooks to reduce repetitive code.
