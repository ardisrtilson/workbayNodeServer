When you're trying to come up with a great cover design for a book, magazine, or brochure, a good rule of thumb is to keep it simple. An uncluttered design is striking, easy to read, and easy to adapt. In this short course, John McWade shows us an existing cover for a brochure and explains how to reduce the visual elements (fonts, frames, colors, etc.) so the design is more cohesive and strong. He then goes on to show how to alter the design to create quick variations. Make sure to download the free PDF, Design Like a Lazy Person, for more handy cover design tips.
