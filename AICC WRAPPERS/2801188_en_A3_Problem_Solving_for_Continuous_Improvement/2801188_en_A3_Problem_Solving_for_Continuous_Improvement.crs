[Course_Description]
A3 helps companies learn and achieve sustainable solutions. When problems donâ€™t have a single root cause, a cross-functional team approach is required to identify multiple contributing causes and find holistic solutions. The A3 process guides your team through a step-by-step process laid out on an 11 x 17-inch worksheet. In this course, lean author Sam Yankelevitch explains how to adopt the A3 process in order to approach problems, improve results, and drive organizational learning. Discover how to clarify the role of each stakeholder, identify and quantify the problem, find multiple contributing causes, and brainstorm countermeasures. Plus, learn how to create an action plan that everybody agrees on, measure results, and share lessons learned with the rest of your organization.
