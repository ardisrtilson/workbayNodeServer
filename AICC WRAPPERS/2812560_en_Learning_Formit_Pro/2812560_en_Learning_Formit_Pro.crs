[Course_Description]
Autodesk FormIt Pro allows architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) pros to create, collaborate, and analyze building projects—on the web, an iPad, or the desktop. It offers intuitive modeling tools for massing and schematic design as well as intelligent energy analysis. This course is an introduction to FormIt Pro for complete beginners. Instructor Jim Cowan shows how to create linework, surfaces, and 3D forms; connect to real-time data; and add cameras and animation. Jim also walks through two real-world workflows—one for energy analysis and one for presentation—and closes with some tips demonstrating the smooth integration of FormIt Pro with other BIM tools such as Revit and SketchUp.
