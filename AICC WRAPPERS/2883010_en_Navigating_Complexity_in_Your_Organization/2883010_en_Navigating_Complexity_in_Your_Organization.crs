[Course_Description]
The world is evolving at warp speed, and trying to keep up can sometimes be too much, too quickly. Organizations fail to keep up when uncertainty goes unchecked and rogue complexities take root. In this course, learn how to navigate an ever-changing work culture with executive development coach Timothy Smith. Timothy shares his three key methods for overcoming uncertainty and rooting out complexity: communication, connection, and collaboration. He gives you tools to improve communication, a framework for building powerful relational networks, and a guide for fostering teamwork in turbulence. After watching this course, you should be able to spot ways to simplify your processes, clarify your objectives, and drive success during both smooth and challenging times.
