It's a vendor-neutral certification that ensures administrators can manage a variety of systems, including web servers, virtual servers, mail servers, and more. Our series, CompTIA Server+ Cert Prep, is designed to help you prepare for and pass the exam. In this course, Ed Liberman helps you study for the security objectives. Review the three major layers of security—server, network, and data—as well as concepts such as multifactor authentication, logical access control, and environmental security.
