[Course_Description]
Most budgets fail. But it’s not because the people who made them failed—it’s because they were set up to fail. Budgets are useless if they don’t work in real life. In this course, learn how to create a budget that meets you where you are. Financial planner and fintech consultant Natalie Taylor explains how to overcome the most common budgeting pitfalls, budget based on your values, and set achievable goals. She also shares tips on balancing spending and saving, discusses how to plan for unexpected costs, and demystifies the question of “How can I budget and still enjoy life?” If you want to transform your budgets from stressful to successful, take this course to build a budget that works for you. This course was created by Madecraft. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
