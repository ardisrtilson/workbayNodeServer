Microsoft Project is a robust tool for managing project deadlines, tasks, and resources. Get a quick crash course with Project Management Professional (PMP) Bonnie Biafore. Bonnie begins by showing how to create a basic project and set up your work calendar. Next, she walks through creating and modifying tasksâ€”the building blocks of any project. Bonnie also covers how to assign resources to your project and address resource overallocations. Finally, learn how to communicate your plan using the built-in reports and visualizations, such as one-click burndown charts.
