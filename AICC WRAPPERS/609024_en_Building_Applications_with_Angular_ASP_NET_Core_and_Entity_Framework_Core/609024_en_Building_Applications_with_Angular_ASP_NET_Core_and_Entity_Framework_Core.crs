[Course_Description]
Creating a complete full-stack application requires integrating multiple components. The front-end piece must talk smoothly to the server, and within the server, you'll need multiple layers: one to talk with the client, and one to store information on the server. This course teaches integration through the perspective of a quiz project, with instructor Alexander Zanfir showing how to use Angular, ASP.NET Core, and Entity Framework Core to develop a full-stack application. Alexander explains how to display and edit data in Angular with ASP.NET Core, create forms, navigate to different views, and more.
