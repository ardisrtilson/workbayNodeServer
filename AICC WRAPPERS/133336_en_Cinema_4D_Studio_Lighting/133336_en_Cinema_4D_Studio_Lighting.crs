[Course_Description]
It's not enough to know about the many light types available in CINEMA 4Dâ€”you need to know how and where to place them to create a desired effect. In this course, Donovan Keith covers some basic photographic lighting concepts and shows how to turn CINEMA 4D into a powerful virtual lighting studio. Learn how to reveal the form and texture of diffuse objects, and use special techniques for lighting reflective and transparent surfaces. Donovan also shows how to accurately place highlights in order to shape the contours of objects, and use contrasting light and shadow to dramatic effect.
