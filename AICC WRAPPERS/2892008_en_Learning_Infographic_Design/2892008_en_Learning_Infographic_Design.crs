[Course_Description]
To create a truly successful infographic, you must understand the power of visual communication. Properly executed visuals can connect with an audience faster than any other form of communication. In this course, Amy Balliett, CEO and Founder of Killer Visual Strategies, shows you how to create engaging and successful infographics that stand out from the crowd. Amy shows you how to dissect a bad infographic, to learn what not to do. She shows you how visual communication shines through, even in infographics that aren’t in your native language, then goes over how to leverage visual cues and hooks. Amy introduces the five Ws that you need to identify when designing your infographic and explains why it’s so important to research before design even starts. She walks you through each step of wireframing your infographic and concludes with putting the full design together in Adobe Illustrator. Note: This course was created by Killer Visual Strategies, a Material Company. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
