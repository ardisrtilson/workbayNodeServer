[Course_Description]
Adobe Fonts, formally known as Typekit, is a font subscription service that lets you activate fonts for use in desktop applications and on websites. As part of a Creative Cloud subscription you have access to a library of more than 15,000 fonts available for personal and commercial use. The fonts are from leading font foundries and can be used in print and on screen. If you're interested in learning how Adobe Fonts works—and how it could benefit your design workflow—then this course is for you. Join instructor Nigel French as he shows how to choose, activate, and manage fonts; add fonts to your website; activate fonts in InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop; and more.
