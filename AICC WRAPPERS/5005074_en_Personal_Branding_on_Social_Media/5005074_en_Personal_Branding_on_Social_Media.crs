When it comes to social media, you need more than just a well-lit headshot and a witty tagline to cut through the noise. Professionals of all stripes—from amateur food bloggers to CEOs—need to craft a strong, authentic personal brand that’s consistent across multiple social media platforms. In this course, instructor Jennifer Jessie shows how to do just that, explaining how to create a profile that’s tailored to your ideal customer, craft compelling content, and target your audience on top social media platforms. Jennifer explains how to highlight your expertise without sounding like you’re boasting, determine how often to update your profiles, and track your progress. Plus, learn when to invest in ads, how to create a cross-platform plan for posting content, and more.
