[Course_Description]
Learn how to create custom gradient meshes with these Illustrator tutorials from lynda.com staff author Justin Seeley. Gradient meshes are the key to precisely controlling gradients and creating realistic highlights and shadows in your artwork. Here Justin shows how to create your first mesh; manipulate the points, color, and texture of meshes; and create meshes for a variety of real-world, hands-on projects, from 3D models to color-rich poster designs. Make sure to take the challenge Justin issues at the end of the course to practice your skills and fire up your next Illustrator project.
