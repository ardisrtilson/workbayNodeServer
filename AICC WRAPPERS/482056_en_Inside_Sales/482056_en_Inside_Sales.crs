Inside sales professionals face a noisy, crowded, and fast-paced marketplace with distracted and risk-averse decision makers. In this course, best-selling author and global inside sales expert Josiane Feigon helps you build the trust you need to capture the interest from today's buyer. She helps you understand what attributes you need to be successful, what your customer expects from you, what tools you should use, and how to establish your plan, set your goals, and do your pre-call research. Once you're prepared, she walks you through the specific techniques of the sale, including getting past gatekeepers, overcoming objections, and closing the sale.
