[Course_Description]
Drones have become the standard for aerial photography. In the past, photographers and videographers had to hire an airplane or helicopter. Today remote pilots can do the job! Many photographers have an aerial vehicle to supplement their earth-bound cameras. In this course, instructors Luisa Winters and Francis Torres cover in depth the core information you need to do professional work with your drone. Topics include the basis of legal issues; how to get clients; how to fly your drone for construction, cinematic, and real estate clients; special considerations when flying your drone at night; and how to fly for hyperlapses and 360-degree video. Get informed and maximize the potential of your drone! Note: This course was created by Luisa Winters. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
