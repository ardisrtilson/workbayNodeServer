[Course_Description]
Learn how to move a player on a tile-based 2D map and use that movement to trigger eventsâ€”creating a gaming experience similar to classic RPGs. In this course, Jesse Freeman builds upon the lessons learned in the Unity 5 2D: Random Map Generation: adding a player, moving the player from tile to tile, and making the camera follow the movement, as well as triggering events on the map. Jesse also shows how to add a fog of war effect that reveals parts of the map as the player moves around and explores, and how to detect and update the artwork for visited tiles.
