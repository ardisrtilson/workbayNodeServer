As a new leader, you have to hit the ground running. In this course, adapted from the popular podcast How to Be Awesome at Your Job, host Pete Mockaitis and executive coach Pam Fox Rollin explore the rules for rising leaders. Learn how to switch the story from “me” to “us”: the product, the team, the company. Discover how to come in with a plan and pick smart, quick wins to make allies and boost morale. Get tips to conduct unmissable meetings that get everyone engaged, and respond to feedback with openness and curiosity. Pam also introduces a simple, five-step framework for presenting issues and your positions on them without alienating your staff.
