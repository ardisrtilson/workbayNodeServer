[Course_Description]
Learn how to bring a storyboard to life. Rich Harrington starts this course by showing how to scan hand-drawn storyboards as well as assemble storyboards from photos or frame grabs. Once your ideas are digitized, you'll learn how to use Photoshop to enhance the artwork with additional line work and color and split your project into layered files. Then learn how to turn those files into engaging animatics in After Effects. In the final chapter, you'll create an assembly edit in After Effects, complete with a temporary music track, to help you share your artistic vision with clients.
