[Course_Description]
Graphic design from the Victorian era (roughly 1837 to 1901) is embodied by its ornate, decorative elements, which seem to conflict with our more modern and restrained aesthetic. But the craftsmanship and elegance of these designs can still provide inspiration for your own. In this short course, designer Nigel French provides a historical background on Victorian type and then takes you through a step-by-step process to create a new design inspired by a nineteenth-century original. He shows how to choose period-appropriate typefaces and demonstrates Illustrator and Photoshop techniques applicable to any time frame, including skewed type paths, offset shadows, woodcut-style shading, framing devices, and texture.
