[Course_Description]
Self-image is a powerful driving force for consumers. The desire to be seen and admired is, in part, what makes influencers with aspirational lifestyles effective marketing tools and compels people to keep up with the latest trends. In this installment of the Evil by Design series, learn how to use this knowledge to your advantage. Instructor Chris Nodder discusses the impact of envy and differences in status, why cognitive dissonance and managing the gap between truth and fiction can be a challenge for designers, and how people can be unconsciously ignorant of their own ignorance (and how this impacts the language of persuasive design). Chris also digs into the grey areas of this design strategy, helping you discern how far you should take these dark patterns.
