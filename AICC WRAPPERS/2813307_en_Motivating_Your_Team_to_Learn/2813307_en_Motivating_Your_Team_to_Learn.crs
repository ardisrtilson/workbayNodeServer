[Course_Description]
Getting employees to engage with training is hard. Adult learners don’t have the same time and energy as full-time students. By understanding what motivates people to acquire a new skill—whether it's a new procedure, an updated piece of software, or retraining for a new job entirely—you can break down barriers to learning and create more effective training with greater participation. In this course, Stefan Mumaw provides 10 tips to build engagement into your L&D. Find out how to make your program’s value clear, engage your employees’ senses, improve the relevance of training, add some friendly competition, and more. He also explores the psychology of motivation, so you can understand what your learners really want from training—and use it to create stronger learning strategies.
