[Course_Description]
Get up and running with Inventor 2021, the professional product and mechanical design software from Autodesk. In this course, instructor John Helfen reviews the essential tools and techniques of this parametric design system, explaining how to build parts and assemblies and document them in a way that helps others understand how your designs can be manufactured. Learn how to create a sketch and turn it into a 3D part with the Extrude, Revolve, and Loft tools. Find out how to combine multiple parts into an assembly to test the interactionsâ€”before you spend time and money on manufacturing. Finally, discover how to document your designs with drawings, and enhance them with visual styles and annotations.
