If you're looking for your dream job, you have to be prepared to act quickly. That means having an incredible, on-point, you had us at hello resume. Is yours in working order? This course helps anyone make over a lackluster resume into something truly special. Career strategist and nationally recognized resume writer Jenny Foss takes you through the very same process she uses at JobJenny.com to develop resumes for her own clients. She teaches you how to condense years of experience into a compelling marketing document, address resume gaps and job hops, and choose the right format for the final document. She also explains how the hiring process works (from the perspective of both the resume scanning software and the human reviewer), so that when you do apply for that incredible new job, you have a real shot at landing an interview.
