[Course_Description]
Writing long works like novels and dissertations can be a chaotic process. Scrivener—a popular writing software—can help authors research, write, edit, and publish long documents. Scrivener expert Laura Bergells shows how to get the most out of this powerful writing tool. She explores how to navigate the interface, plan a new project, and use the research folder to keep track of project-related assets. She covers the software's writing and editing features. Finally, Laura goes into preset compilation options—and shows writers how they can share their work as a word processing file, a PDF document, or an ebook.
