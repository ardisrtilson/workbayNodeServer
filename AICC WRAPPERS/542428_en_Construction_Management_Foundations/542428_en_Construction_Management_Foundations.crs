[Course_Description]
Shifts in the modern construction industry have both increased the demand for trained and qualified construction managers, and expanded the role itself. With a greater emphasis being placed on integrated methods of project delivery—as opposed to the old design, bid, build approach—there's a real need for construction professionals who not only know their way around field methods, but also have a solid understanding of building science and design in their toolkit. Whether you're a construction industry veteran looking to switch roles or a brand new construction manager trying to get your bearings, this course provides you with meaningful insights into this vital, evolving industry and your role in it. Instructor Jim Rogers explains how integrated project delivery methods work, how technology is shaking up old processes, and how lean productivity methods are being used at construction sites. Throughout the course, you'll get industry knowledge from Jim, as well as other experienced construction professionals.
