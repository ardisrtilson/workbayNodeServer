[Course_Description]
What do you get when you combine all five installments of EPK Editing Workflows? An electronic press kit that truly shines. This final installment walks you through the way Maxim Jago creates a finished, professional press-kit video, using a mixture of techniques described in previous lessons, from selecting content and adding effects to outputting your master project. Maxim describes the actual choices he made, the creative and technical background of those choices, and the techniques that made the project work.
