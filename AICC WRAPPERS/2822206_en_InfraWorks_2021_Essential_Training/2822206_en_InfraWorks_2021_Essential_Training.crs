InfraWorks offers civil engineering, GIS, and site visualization features in one complete program, making it possible to create realistic 3D cities from the ground up. This course helps you get up to speed with all the essential features of InfraWorks as you follow along creating a full-featured residential community, complete with drainage networks, roads, bridges, and building models. Learn how to import model and terrain data from other programs and add style and detail—such as trees, water, utilities, sky, and roads—to your world. Instructor Gordon Luckett also shows you how to export and share your design with colleagues and clients around the globe.
