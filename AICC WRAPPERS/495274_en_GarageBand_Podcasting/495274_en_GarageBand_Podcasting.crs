Want to start your own podcast? GarageBand is one of the easiest and most inexpensive tools to use. In this course, author Garrick Chow demonstrates how to make and publish a high-quality podcast using GarageBand. He starts with the basics: what a podcast is and the steps it takes to turn a raw idea into something ready for listeners. He then shows how to plan and record a podcast, how to choose the right audio gear, and how to configure GarageBand. Once your audio is recorded, Garrick shows how to edit the material, add music, and apply effects. Garrick wraps up the course by discussing how to export and publish your podcast on popular hosting sites such as Libsyn and SoundCloud.
