[Course_Description]
These days, designers are asked to do more: UX, motion, 3D, and, very often, photography. This project-based training course is specifically designed for the creative professional who wants to shoot quality photos for both graphic design jobs and stand-alone photo projects. Designer Jim Krause teaches the basics of photography and takes the everyday designer through a series of projects to get them out of the design studio and into the wild, shooting great photographs. He covers the equipment you'll need to get professional-looking results, lighting techniques, and post-production strategies using tools like Photoshop and Lightroom. Most of all, he offers the encouragement that designers and non-designers alike need to get out there and start taking photographs. With the right mindset, you may never need to buy a stock photo again.
