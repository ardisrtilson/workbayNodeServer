Each of your coworkers have their own unique working styles. Whether you admire or feel challenged by a colleague's approach, you can still find a way to connect with them. In their 2018 book Business Chemistry, Kim Christfort and Suzanne Vickberg lay out how to do this, highlighting the most common working styles, as well as how to create an environment where each type of person can thrive. In this audiobook summary, learn about the different types of personalities you'll encounter at work—from the forward-thinking Pioneer to the cautious Guardian—and get tips for connecting with these individuals and helping them succeed.
