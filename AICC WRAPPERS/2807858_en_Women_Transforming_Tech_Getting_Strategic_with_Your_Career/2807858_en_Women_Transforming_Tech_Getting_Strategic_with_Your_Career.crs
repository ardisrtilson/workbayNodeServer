[Course_Description]
The unfortunate reality is that building a career in technology has proven more difficult for women than it has for men. Not only do women hold less tech jobs, but they also don't stay in tech for as long as men do. However, you can beat the odds and take charge of your career by getting strategic. This short course, led by Silicon Valley investor Megan Holsten-Alexander, covers strategies for breaking in and staying in the tech industry. Learn how to find the next job to climb the “career tree,” network with peers and mentors, set goals, ask for what you’re worth, and develop a direct communication style that propels you forward.
