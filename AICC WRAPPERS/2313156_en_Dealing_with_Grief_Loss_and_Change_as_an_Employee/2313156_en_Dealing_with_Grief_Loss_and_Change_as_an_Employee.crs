[Course_Description]
What makes grief, loss, and change so challenging is the difficulty we have experiencing and expressing unpleasant feelings. The COVID-19 pandemic, economic downtown, and related challenges have brought these feelings into the workplace. As an employee, it can be difficult to balance grief and loss with professional responsibilities, especially since many organizations don't have a script for handling these situations. This timely course from Joan Rosenberg, PhD, is a strategic and practical guide to building core emotional strength, reducing anxiety, and developing the confidence needed to navigate grief, loss and change. Combining more than three decades of clinical experience with the latest psychology, mindfulness, and neuroscience research, Joan helps learners understand what grief really is and how to manage the impact of loss and change.
