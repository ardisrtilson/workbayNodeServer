Join instructor Matt Heinz as he shows you how to hit your business goals with practical strategies designed to elevate the impact, sophistication, and results from demand generation programs. First, Matt covers tactics for developing goals and objectives, including a funnel model, as well as risk factors and pivot points. He then goes over how to define your target audience and understand what steps your prospects go through to evaluate, justify, and confirm purchase decisions. Matt demonstrates the steps to develop a campaign, including how to drive precise messages and offers throughout your demand generation programs. Once youâ€™ve developed a campaign, you must execute the plan and follow up. Matt outlines playbook elements that you can introduce to your sales organization to increase efficiency and consistency in executing campaign plans, and then steps through how to support greater lead conversion by your sales teams.
