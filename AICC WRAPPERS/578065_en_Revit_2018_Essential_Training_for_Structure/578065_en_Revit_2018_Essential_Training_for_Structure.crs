[Course_Description]
Revit 2018 is a great program for structural engineering, offering cutting-edge tools for creating design alternatives, building simulations, and publishing clear, easy-to-share documentation. This training course focuses on the major components of Revit used for structural design and is designed for the user who prefers to work in imperial units (inches and feet). Starting with referencing an architectural model, you'll learn how to add foundations, rebar, and framing; set up views and drawings; model slabs and trusses; and build a whole lot more. This course is designed for members with no Revit experience, or for more advanced users who want to jump to a topic and start from there. Either way, this comprehensive course will teach you what you need to know to be dangerous in Revit structure.
