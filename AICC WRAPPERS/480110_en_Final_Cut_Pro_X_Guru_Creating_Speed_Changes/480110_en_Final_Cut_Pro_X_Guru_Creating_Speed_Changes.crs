Final Cut X has impressive time remapping features that allow you to bend time: slow things down, speed them up, reverse action, or even freeze frames. Learn how to enhance your storytelling with Final Cut Pro speed changes, and get the best quality renders from your time-remapped footage. Jeff Greenberg introduces the technical and creative possibilities with Final Cut Pro's Custom Speed dialog, automatic adjustments such as Speed Ramp and Instant Replay, the Range and Blade Speed tools, and Apple Motion. Plus, learn how to use high-frame-rate footage for the perfect slo-mo effect.
