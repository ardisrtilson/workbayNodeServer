When you’re shooting a video for a corporate client, there are a multitude of considerations you need to address before, during, and after the shoot, and many of them have little to do with the actual shooting of the video. In this course, instructors Amy DeLouise and Richard Harrington share their proven strategies for a production workflow to help you ensure your next corporate shoot goes as smoothly as possible. Amy and Richard cover the entire timeline of the video, from preproduction logistics, equipment choices, and time and locations, to planning and conducting interviews, getting releases signed, and keeping your media files backed up and stored safely. There are many factors that go into a successful corporate video production, and with Richard and Amy’s tips you’ll be able to prepare better and avoid common pitfalls.
