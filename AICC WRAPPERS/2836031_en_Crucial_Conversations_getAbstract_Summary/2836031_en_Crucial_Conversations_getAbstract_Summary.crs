[Course_Description]
Many people recoil from “crucial conversations,” where they have to negotiate to get ahead. Crucial Conversations—the best-selling book by Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzler—describes techniques for effective negotiation and conflict resolution in the context of potentially life-changing conversations. This audio-only summary of their book, produced by getAbstract, provides strategies you can use to communicate thoughtfully when the stakes are high. Whether you need to talk yourself into a promotion, bring up important data at a meeting, or even work out problems with your spouse, this summary provides practical tips that can help you calmly and clearly make your point. Plus, the authors also highlight themes people often forget in negotiations, such as making it safe for others to express themselves, avoiding being forced into false choices, and being alert to unstated agendas or alternatives. This audiobook summary was created by getAbstract, the world’s largest provider of business book summaries. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
