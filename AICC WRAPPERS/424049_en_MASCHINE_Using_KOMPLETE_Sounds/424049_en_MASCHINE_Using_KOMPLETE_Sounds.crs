[Course_Description]
Native Instruments, makers of MASCHINE and the KOMPLETE suite of virtual instruments, have tightly integrated these two products. In this course, author JK Swopes will demonstrate how to use the pair for songwriting and music production, and configure your plugin preferences so you can browse, load, and use KOMPLETE sounds easily within MASCHINE. He also demonstrates how to create melodic elements, build beats, add effects, and build a song within MASCHINE using scene and pattern variationsâ€”all based on sounds from the KOMPLETE library.
