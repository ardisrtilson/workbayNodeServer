[Course_Description]
Learn how to select the right HR information system (HRIS) for your organization. An HRIS is designed to manage the data of the workplace and the entire employee lifecycle: from hiring to managing payroll, benefits, and training. Due to advances in technology and decreases in cost, these solutions are more realistic for all companiesâ€”but not all HR systems are made alike. This course can help you identify an HRIS system that will work best for your company. Learn what internal factors to consider in your purchase, including day-to-day and strategic company needs. Discover how to identify potential vendors, and generate request for information (RFIs) and requests for proposals (RFPs) in order to solicit bids. Instructor Don Phin also explains the right questions to ask at every stage of the buying process.
