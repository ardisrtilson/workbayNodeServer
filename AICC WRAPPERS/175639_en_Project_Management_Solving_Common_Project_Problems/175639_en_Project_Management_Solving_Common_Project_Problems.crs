When you're balancing the triple constraints of project management (cost/quality/time) and trying to accomplish something new, problems are bound to crop up. In the course, project management trainer Chris Croft shows how to solve the most common problems that arise when working on projects. By breaking these issues into 4 major categories—people problems, quality problems, cost problems, and time problems—he provides helpful advice and techniques for how to handle them.
