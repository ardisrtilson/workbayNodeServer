[Course_Description]
Until recently, most Americans equated the end of a successful career with the beginning of retirement. No more. Now, they want to stay in the game—or better yet, change it. They want to leave a mark, make a difference, and continue to make money. In this course, Marci Alboher, VP of Encore.org author of The Encore Career Handbook: How to Make a Living and a Difference in the Second Half of Life, walks you through how to jump-start an encore career that may be the most important work you'll ever love. She'll spark your thinking on how much you need to make, when to volunteer, how to harness the power of social media, and more. Throughout the course, Marci shares practical tips and strategies—as well as her own encore journey—to help you find the work that will sustain you in this new stage of life.
