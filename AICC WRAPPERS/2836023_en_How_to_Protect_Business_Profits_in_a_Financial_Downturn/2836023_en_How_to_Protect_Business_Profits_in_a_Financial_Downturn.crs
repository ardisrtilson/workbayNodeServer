Recessions often hit small businesses hard. Unlike large corporations, small companies, local shops, and other small organizations may not have large cash reserves and will need to make tough choices. But even when times are tough, business owners with the right tactics can still keep their doors open and may find new opportunities for growth. In this course, economist and consultant Jason Schenker shows you how, sharing practical strategies for making your small business recession proof. Discover how to cut costs across your organization without cutting labor first, including how to analyze and prioritize your spending and renegotiate with vendors. Get best practices for making tough decisions about staffing and operations. Plus, learn how to limit the downside risks of a recession for your business, as well as what you can do to create opportunities to help your organization thrive in a downturn.
