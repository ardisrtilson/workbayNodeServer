[Course_Description]
Historic building information modeling (HBIM) is the process of using digital tools like 3D scanning and architectural software like Revit to document historically significant locations all over the world. Project Soane is a crowd-sourced mission to resurrect Sir John Soane's lost Bank of England design using modern BIM software. In this course, Paul F. Aubin shows how you can use Revit to rebuild history and submit your own contributions to historical reconstruction projects like Project Soane. He also shows how to create stunning renderings of the finished model using Revit, Showcase, and 3ds Max.
