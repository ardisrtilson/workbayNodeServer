[Course_Description]
Ethical hacking involves testing to see if an organization's network is vulnerable to outside threats. Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are one of the biggest threats out there. Being able to mitigate DoS attacks is one of the most desired skills for any IT security professionalâ€”and a key topic on the Certified Ethical Hacker exam. In this course, learn about the history of the major DoS attacks and the types of techniques hackers use to cripple wired and wireless networks, applications, and services on the infrastructure. Instructor Malcolm Shore covers the basic methods hackers use to flood networks and damage services, the rising threat of ransomware like Cryptolocker, mitigation techniques for detecting and defeating DoS attacks, and more. Note: The Ethical Hacking series maps to the 20 parts of the EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) exam (312_50) version 10.
