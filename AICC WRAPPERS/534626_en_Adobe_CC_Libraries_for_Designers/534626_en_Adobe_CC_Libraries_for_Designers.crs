[Course_Description]
With Adobe Creative Cloud (CC) Libraries, you can manage and access design assets—like frequently used brushes and icons—from anywhere. In this brief, informative course, Justin Seeley shows graphic designers how to leverage the power of CC Libraries across key design applications. To begin, Justin explains what CC Libraries are, how to create them on both desktops and mobile devices, and how to share your libraries with colleagues. Next, he explains how to work with CC Libraries in Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, as well as which objects you store in each one. Justin wraps up with recommendations for other courses that can help you grow your CC knowledge.
