[Course_Description]
For many professionals, remaining constantly connected and on task can feel like a requirement for success. Long hours and chronic exhaustion are normalized—if not celebrated—in many workplaces. But a lack of boundaries between work and life can cause even the hardest workers among us to wind up resentful and unhappy—even in jobs that once fulfilled them. In this course, instructor Emilie Aries breaks down what burnout is, what causes it, and how to take back your power and energy. Discover how to identify your burnout triggers—whether it's lack of agency, rest, community, or purpose—and take steps to reframe your situation and get help. Plus, get practical strategies to ensure that you kick burnout to the curb for good.
