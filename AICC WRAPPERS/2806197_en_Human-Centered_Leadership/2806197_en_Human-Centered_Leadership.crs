[Course_Description]
What keeps certain companies standing strong year after year, while others fall away? While myriad factors contribute to a company's longevity, the presence—or absence—of caring and compassionate leaders plays a particularly critical role. The future of business requires organizations to adopt a human-centered view of leadership. In this course, Sesil Pir shares strategies designed to help you connect to your purpose as a leader and build more sustainable organizations. Sesil provides a historical view of leadership and management and highlights new perspectives that challenge the status quo of work. She introduces the core human attributes necessary for human-centered leadership and shares inside-out and outside-in interventions for supporting the development of trust-based environments.
