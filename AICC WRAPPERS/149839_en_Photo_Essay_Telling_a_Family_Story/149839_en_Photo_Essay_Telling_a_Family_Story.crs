[Course_Description]
A rewarding photographic project involves shooting an essay that tells the story of a family member in a certain place and time: the brother with an interesting job or hobby, the grandparent with a lifetime of stories and experiences, or the parent you finally got to know as an adult. For a photographic storyteller, family members are great but challenging subjects, often more challenging than strangers to capture objectively. In this course, photojournalist Paul Taggart explores the unique challenges of documenting family as he shoots a photo essay about his brother, an amateur astronomer, avid ham radio operator, off-roading enthusiast, and dedicated father in rural Oklahoma.
