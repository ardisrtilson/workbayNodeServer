[Course_Description]
When it comes to challenges occurring in a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) business environment, organizations that learn and adapt have a huge competitive advantage. Leaders need to adjust as wellâ€”often making a big shift because their role can be process and rule oriented. In this course, learn how to apply systems thinking to an organizational structure and discover a new model of leadership, the VMCL framework (vision, mission, capacity, learning). Derek Cabrera shares how to leverage the framework to become more responsive and successful in a rapid and changing world.
