[Course_Description]
Imposter syndrome can make even celebrated, successful people feel small. Sufferers of imposter syndrome often feel like they haven't truly earned their accomplishments, and that it's only a matter of time until they're found out. They credit their capabilities and accomplishments to things outside themselves, such as luck. Or, the imposter may be unaware that they are in the middle of a normal learning curve. In this course, adapted from the podcast How to Be Awesome at Your Job, Dr. Valerie Young shines a spotlight on impostor syndrome and shares a healthy way out of this mental trap. Learn how to shift your mindset by reframing how you think about competence, criticism, and fear. Discover how to celebrate your successes and reward yourself for your efforts, no matter the outcome, as well as consider all things to be opportunities for learning and growth. Plus, Dr. Young discusses the arrogance behind imposter syndrome, and how holding yourself back is bad for everyone. This course was created by Pete Mockaitis of How to Be Awesome at Your Job. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
