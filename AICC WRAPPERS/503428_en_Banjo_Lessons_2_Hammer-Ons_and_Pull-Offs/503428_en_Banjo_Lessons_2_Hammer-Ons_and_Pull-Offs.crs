[Course_Description]
Learn how to play banjo with United States Artists Friends Fellow and multi-Grammy nominee Tony Trischka. For more than 35 years, Tony has inspired and instructed countless bluegrass and acoustic musicians. Learn at your own pace from the comfort of your home, or anywhere else you can carry your instrument and your learning device. This 4-part definitive video library includes hundreds of banjo lessons and performances, plus banjo tabs, backing tracks, and other study materials. Once you've mastered the fundamentals, Part 2 teaches you how to play more carefully, with increased speed and mastery, and use hammer-ons and pull-offs to play specific note combinations in a smooth and connected way. Tony introduces some exercises to help you correct your posture and train your ear, as well as variations of popular banjo tunes such as John Hardy and Down in the Valley. Note: This course was recorded and produced by ArtistWorks. We are honored to host this training in our library.
