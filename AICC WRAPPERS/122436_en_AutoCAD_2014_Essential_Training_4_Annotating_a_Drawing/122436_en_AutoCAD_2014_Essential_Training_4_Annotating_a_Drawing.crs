[Course_Description]
Join CAD trainer Jeff Bartels, as he shows how to create and edit text and dimensions in your drawings, and control the appearance of those annotations using styles. Plus, learn to add callouts, aka multileaders, to highlight features or add notes to a drawing. The last chapter includes a drawing challenge that gives you a chance to use what you've learned, followed by a demonstration where Jeff shows how to solve the challenge.
