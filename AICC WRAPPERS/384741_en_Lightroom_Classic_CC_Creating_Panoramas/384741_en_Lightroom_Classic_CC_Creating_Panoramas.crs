[Course_Description]
Whether the subject is landscape or architecture, a great panoramic photo offers a new perspective that can really capture the viewer's attention. The process of creating panoramic photos has gotten even easier with the release of Lightroom 6 and Lightroom Classic CC. You can now combine multiple images into a new file and even preserve the flexibility of raw photo editing. Additionally, by combining Lightroom and Photoshop you can get a most advanced level of control over the final results. Rich Harrington introduces all these techniques, plus a workflow for creating high dynamic range (HDR) panoramas.
