[Course_Description]
There is a strategic side and a practical side to direct mail. To get results, you need to pay close attention to both. After all, wouldn't it be a shame to put tremendous effort into a winning strategy and design, only to lose money on postal surcharges due to a careless formatting error? This course teaches members the most critical skills to planning and sending direct mail, from tips for staying on budget while pushing the envelope creatively, to navigating and implementing the US Postal Service's technical guidelines with ease. Author Trish Witkowski is a specialist in direct mail, and she'll help you plan and send engaging and cost-efficient campaigns that grab the attention of recipients the moment they open their mailbox.
