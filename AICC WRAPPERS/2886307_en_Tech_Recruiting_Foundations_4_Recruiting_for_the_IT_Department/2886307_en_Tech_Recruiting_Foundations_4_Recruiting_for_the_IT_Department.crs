[Course_Description]
Tech is one of those rare places where demand for jobs is higher than the supply. With that in mind, how can recruiters and hiring managers get the best candidates for the job into the jobs theyâ€™re trying to fill? One way is by understanding the tech well enough to know exactly what you need. In this series of courses, instructor Ayub Shaikh goes over high-level IT concepts and breaks them into related, easy-to-remember groupings. This course focuses on how you can recruit successfully for an IT department. Ayub introduces you to the roles that exist in the modern IT department, as well as internal and outsourced needs. He walks you through finding cloud-capable candidates and exploring the different silos into which IT roles are often grouped. Ayub concludes this course with a discussion of some caveats and considerations that you may encounter for networking and ops roles. Note: This course was created by Holistica Consulting.
