[Course_Description]
InDesign gets better every year. 2020 is no exception. This course is your tour of the latest and greatest, and will keep you up to date with new features as soon as they are released. Anne-Marie Concepción reviews the refreshed interface as well as the changes that take place under the hood, such as stability, speed, and accessibility enhancements. Get familiar with the new image and text features that are most exciting to today’s designers, including long-awaited support for variable fonts and SVG images, as well as automatic column rules and style shortcuts. Learn how to find and use enhancements to Data Merge, spell check, and Creative Cloud search. Like the Creative Cloud, this course will keep evolving. Check back for new videos every time Adobe releases an update.
