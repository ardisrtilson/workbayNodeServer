[Course_Description]
Learn how to quickly enhance your images with Photos for macOS—the built-in photo editing app. This course introduces nondestructive workflows that improve an image but maintain flexibility for future editing. Instructor Rich Harrington uses real-world examples—raw and JPEG files shot with DSLR cameras and iPhones—so you can get a realistic picture of how far you can take your own images. Discover how to correct color, exposure, white balance, and contrast; create dramatic black-and-white imagery; and add finishing details such as sharpening and vignettes. Rich also covers integrating extensions and external editors into the Photos workflow. Whether you're brand new to Photos or transitioning from another app, this course will help you get the best-looking results with its features. This course was created by Rhed Pixel. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
