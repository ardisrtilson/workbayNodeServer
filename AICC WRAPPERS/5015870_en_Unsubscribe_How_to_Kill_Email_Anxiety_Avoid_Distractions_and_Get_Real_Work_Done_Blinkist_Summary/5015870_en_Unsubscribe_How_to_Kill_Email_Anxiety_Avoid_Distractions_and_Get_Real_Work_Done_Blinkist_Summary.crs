[Course_Description]
Email is supposed to be a tool that helps us do our jobs. But the time we spend responding to unimportant messages (and obsessively emptying our inbox to zero) can actually impede our ability to perform key tasks. In Jocelyn K. Glei's 2016 book, Unsubscribe, she shares strategies for taking control of your inbox. This audiobook summary distills some of the most salient aspects of Unsubscribe into bite-sized tips that can help you organize your inbox, respond to messages in a more efficient manner, write better emails, and more. Note: This audiobook summary was produced by Blinkist. We are pleased to host this content in our library.
