[Course_Description]
While digital marketing has matured, it has also become more complex, and marketers need to think of its many components holistically. A marketing technology, or martech, stack is the set of tools that your marketing team uses to plan, execute, and measure all aspects of your digital marketing objectives. With the explosion of new capabilities, vendors, platforms, and technologies in this space, it's more important than ever to carefully choose your components and build the stack that's right for your organization. In this course, David Booth walks you through a framework that examines the roles and benefits of each layer in the stackâ€”acquisition through marketing and advertising, digital experiences and clickstream measurement, the back-office functions, and analysis. Learn how these technologies can help you drive engagement, measure results, increase sales, and improve customer relationships. Note: While specific software and platforms aren't endorsed, you can see how tools such as a customer relationship management system, web analytics, and more work in a successful marketing mix.
