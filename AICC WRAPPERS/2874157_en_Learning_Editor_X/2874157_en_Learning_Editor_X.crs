[Course_Description]
Today's content management systems are easier to use than ever before. So what does it mean to have an ultra-flexible CMS that isn't too technically difficult to use? In this course, instructor Jen Kramer explains the Editor X workflows and workspace, including how to create and edit content and how to build and publish websites. Jen shows you how to create a project and choose a template, walks you through the interface, and describes how to use the theme manager to configure colors and type. She covers how to add a logo, customize your pageâ€™s navigation, and add a variety of features to your page. Jen steps through reordering sections of your page and building additional pages. She concludes with an explanation of how to launch your Editor X site.
