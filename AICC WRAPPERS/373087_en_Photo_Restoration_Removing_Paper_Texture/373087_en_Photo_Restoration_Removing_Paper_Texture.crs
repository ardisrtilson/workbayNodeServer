[Course_Description]
Many vintage photos were printed on textured, silk-finish photographic paper. If you're restoring an old photo, you'll want to remove this texture to get the cleanest, sharpest results. In this course, master retoucher Neil Rhodes shows a variety of techniques for removing paper texture, from scanning the photo in multiple angles to using a sophisticated Photoshop plugin called FFT to process photos on Windows.
