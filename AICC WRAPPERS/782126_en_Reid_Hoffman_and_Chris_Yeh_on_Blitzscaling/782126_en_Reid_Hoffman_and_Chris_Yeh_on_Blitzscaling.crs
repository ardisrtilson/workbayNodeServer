[Course_Description]
Blitzscaling is a growth strategy that prioritizes speed over efficiency in the face of uncertainty. Those bold enough to adopt it must break free from the confines of business school logic to take uncalculated risks that could just as easily lead to abject failure as rapid-fire growth. In this course, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and entrepreneur Chris Yeh break down when and how entrepreneurs and other business leaders should leverage this tactic to get ahead. Reid and Chris—who literally wrote the book on this topic in 2018's Blitzscaling— explain how, despite the potential pitfalls, blitzscaling practices are often the key to scaling massive companies. They share examples of successful blitzscaling, explain how to blitzscale within a larger organization, and more.
