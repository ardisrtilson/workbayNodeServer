[Course_Description]
When it comes to Photoshop, 3D doesn't require a special pair of glasses, NURBS curves, or subdivision surfaces. In fact, Deke shows how, using the Photoshop skills you have now, you can quickly create 3D objects that look like the real thing, complete with volume, shading, and perspective. This introduction guides you through 3D in Photoshop in the shortest time possible. Deke shows you how to model forms, wrap them with color and surface textures, hang lights in your scene, and add camerasâ€”the windows into your 3D world. Plus, learn how to create 3D type and extrude path outlines so they have the appearance of depth. Get started now on a series of eye-popping 3D projects that will help you get to know Photoshop in a whole new way. New to Photoshop?
