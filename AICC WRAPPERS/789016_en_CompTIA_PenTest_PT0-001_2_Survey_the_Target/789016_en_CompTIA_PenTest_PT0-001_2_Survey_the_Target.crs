[Course_Description]
Earning the CompTIA PenTest+ demonstrates to others in your field that you have the penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and management skills needed to assess a network's resiliency and enhance the overall security posture at an organization. In this course, boost your understanding of scanning and enumeration as you prepare for the Information Gathering & Vulnerability Identification domain of the CompTIA PenTest+ exam. Learn how to pinpoint the weak spots on a network using scanning and enumeration techniques, how to apply a structured approach to determine whether a target has a vulnerability present, and use Nmap scripts to map vulnerabilities to potential exploits. Plus, learn how to leverage a variety of powerful tools, including how to use Wireshark for information gathering and packet inspection. This Total Seminars course covers the exam certification topics.
