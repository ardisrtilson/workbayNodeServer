[Course_Description]
Migrate your animation workflow from Flash to Toon Boom Harmony. While these 2D animation programs are similar, the differences can really prevent an experienced Flash animator from making a smooth transition. Having a concise, go-to guide for comparison, as Dermot O' Connor provides here, is an enormous time saver. Join Dermot as he introduces the Flash tools and their Toon Boom equivalents and shows how to complete common drawing and animation tasks in Harmony, including onion skinning, pivoting and scaling, shape optimization, bitmap tracing, easing, tweening, IK rigging, facial animation, effects, and more. At the end of the course, he'll teach you how to edit audio and export your Toon Boom work as still images and movies.
