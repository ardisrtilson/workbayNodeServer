[Course_Description]
VMware vSphere is everywhere. In order to stay relevant, you must understand vSphere. Perhaps youâ€™re also preparing to take the VMware Certified Professional Datacenter Virtualization (VCP-DCV) exam. In this series of courses, Rick Crisci, a VMware Certified Instructor, walks you through over 50 real life demos in a vSphere 7 environment using the HTML5 vSphere Client. This course focuses specifically on troubleshooting, backup, and recovery. Rick explains that, while problems occur eventually in any environment, you can use mitigation and restoration to limit the damage. He shows you how to use online labs with PuTTy to alter ESXi host settings, then demonstrates how to export logs and work with host logs. Note: This course was created by Rick Crisci. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
