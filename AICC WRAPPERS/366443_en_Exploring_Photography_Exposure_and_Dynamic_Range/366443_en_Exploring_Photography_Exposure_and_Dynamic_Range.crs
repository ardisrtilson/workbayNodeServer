[Course_Description]
This in-depth exploration of exposure and dynamic range will help you understand how digital cameras capture imagesâ€”and enable you to better deal with tricky lighting scenarios. Photographer and teacher Ben Long shows how to balance the three key parameters that dictate how your camera records light: aperture, ISO, and shutter speed. He'll review exactly what good exposure means and where dynamic range comes into play, and explain how you can manipulate exposure using in-camera aids such as Auto ISO and metering modes, and with post-processing software like Photoshop. These techniques will help you understand how your camera sees and give you more technical and creative options when shooting.
