Lean teams are nimble and diverse. They include product managers, developers, and operations specialists, who may only work together for a short time. How do you manage people that play such different roles and unite them towards a common goal? In this course, Jez Humble provides tips to build high-performance product teams. He compares the strengths of the Taylorist vs. lean management approaches, explains how culture contributes to high-performing teams, and introduces a well-documented case study of a company changing a culture for the better.
