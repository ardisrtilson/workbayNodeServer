What sets good content apart from the rest? A solid content strategy is key to delivering a compelling user experience, whether it's a small business website or an app with global reach. This course takes you through the process of analyzing and reshaping your content—not only text but also video, imagery, social interactions, and the metadata that underlies it all—so that it accurately communicates your brand and message and keeps your users coming back. Learn the four elements of constructing meaningful content, from identifying your audience and structuring and wireframing content to developing content guidelines and measuring the success of your efforts. Author Morten Rand-Hendriksen also shows you how to develop persona spectrums to better understand your users and evaluate the needs of important stakeholders and influencers.
