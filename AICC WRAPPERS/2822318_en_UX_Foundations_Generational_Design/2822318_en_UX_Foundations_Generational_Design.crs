[Course_Description]
From Gen Alpha to Baby Boomers, different generations have a range of needs when it comes to user-centered design. Design patterns that work for one generation may not work for others. On top of that, how different generations interact with technology is shifting every day. Thatâ€™s why it's crucial to strategically plan UX design that's going to attract and retain the right audiences and the right customers. In this course, Sarah Weise talks about the differences between generations in regard to user experience and needs, and how to structure your projects to account for a wide range of potential users. She helps you understand generational differences, tailor your research for difference audiences, and use different design patterns to accommodate different generational demographics.
