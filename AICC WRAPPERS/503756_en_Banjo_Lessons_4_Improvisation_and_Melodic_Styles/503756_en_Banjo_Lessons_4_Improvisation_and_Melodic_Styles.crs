[Course_Description]
Learn how to play banjo with United States Artists Friends Fellow and multi-Grammy nominee Tony Trischka. Learn at your own pace from the comfort of your home, or anywhere else you can carry your instrument and your learning device. This 4-part definitive video library includes hundreds of banjo lessons and performances, plus banjo tabs, backing tracks, and other study materials. Part 4 is an advanced course designed to help you strengthen your improvisation skills and melodic style. Tony provides simple exercises, such as melodic scale patterns and single-string scales, to help you practice, and provides tools to add more unique sounds into your repertoire. Plus, learn the backward-alternating thumb roll—a very useful picking pattern for improvising—and advanced scale techniques. As with all the Banjo Lessons courses, Tony breaks down a selection of classic banjo tunes so you can see and hear how the techniques work in a professional's hands. Note: This course was recorded and produced by ArtistWorks. We are honored to host this training in our library.
