[Course_Description]
Difficult people are everywhere—including your office. In this course, adapted from the popular podcast How to Be Awesome at Your Job, psychiatrist Jody Foster offers advice for handling the distinct kinds of difficult people in your workplace. Jody explains how to spot the 10 personality types of difficult people, from narcissists to bean counters. She then lays out some simple rules of engagement, which you can use to make sure everyone knows what is expected in the workplace. Jody also explains how to conduct a self-assessment to make sure you’re not the one who may be causing the problems. Plus, get tips for transitioning to a different work environment and having the difficult conversations required to change the one you’re in. This course was created by Pete Mockaitis of How to Be Awesome at Your Job. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
