[Course_Description]
Statistical analysis often goes beyond simple analysis of variance (ANOVA), which tells you only if a reliable difference exists somewhere—but not specifically where. Sometimes, you may have to determine whether group A’s mean value differs reliably from the mean value of group B, or from that of group C. Multiple comparison tests are the standard for pinpointing these mean differences. In this course, Conrad Carlberg shows how to use Excel and the open-source platform R to run Tukey’s HSD test and the Scheffe ́ multiple comparison test following an ANOVA. Along the way, he discusses related concepts, such as critical values, group size, data snooping, and statistical power, and explains how they influence your choice of tests.
