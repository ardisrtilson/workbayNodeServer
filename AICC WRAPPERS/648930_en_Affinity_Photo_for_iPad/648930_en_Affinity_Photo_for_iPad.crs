[Course_Description]
Affinity Photo is a powerful but approachable image enhancement program that is being embraced by a growing number of photographers. Affinity Photo for the iPad brings the award-winning features of the desktop version to the iPad, and is fully optimized for iOS hardware and touch capabilities. In this course, instructor Steve Caplin shows how to use the image-enhancements features of Affinity Photo for the iPad to do professional-level photo editing on the go. He discusses the interface and works through four real-world projects, such as creating a poster by removing and replacing the background of a portrait. He also shares how to work with raw images, retouch blemishes, and combine exposures, and reviews the advanced features in Affinity Pro, such as tone mapping, distortion correction, and HDR effects. This course was created and produced by Steve Caplin. We are honored to host this training in our library.
