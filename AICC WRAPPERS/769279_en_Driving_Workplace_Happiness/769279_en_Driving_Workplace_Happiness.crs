Employers are always looking for ways to increase engagement and decrease turnover. Part of building engagement is creating opportunities for employees to feel happyâ€”because happy employees are more productive employees.

Catherine Mattice Zundel introduces tangible actions that supervisors, managers, and HR professionals in companies of any size can take to drive happiness, from inspiring altruism and reducing stress to removing incivility and providing meaningful work.
