[Course_Description]
AutoCAD is the leader in CAD drafting, and architects around the world use AutoCAD Architecture for modeling their buildings. In this course, author and teacher Paul F. Aubin will take you through the tools and techniques used by professional architects to build amazing structures with this product. Learn how to lay out simple floor plans with wall objects, which automatically form clean joints, and add windows and doors that intelligently cut wall openings. Then discover how to change the style of walls and the graphics to display all types of drawings—from small scale to large, 2D to 3D—with the click of a button. Paul will also show you how to create documentation like site plans, elevations, and sections, complete with schedules and tags.
