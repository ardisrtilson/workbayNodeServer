[Course_Description]
Productivity improves when people cultivate the habit of asking questions. Growth and performance often stagnate when we tell others (and ourselves) what we should do. In this course, Dave Crenshaw explains why questions are valuable, provides practice creating effective questions, and gives examples of situations where we can ask team members, customers, and those we lead questions that help them grow. Dave discusses what a productive question is and what makes questions productive, then lists some examples of productive questions. He talks about how questions can help people grow and how listening improves questions. After going over how additional questions can help you access more layers of answers, Dave explains times when you should not ask questions, but simply listen. This course was created by Dave Crenshaw and Invaluable Inc. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
