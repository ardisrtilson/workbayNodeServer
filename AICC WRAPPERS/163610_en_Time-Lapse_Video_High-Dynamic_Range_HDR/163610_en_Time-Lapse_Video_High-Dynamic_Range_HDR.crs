[Course_Description]
Take a trip to Zion National Park to shoot an HDR time-lapse video, compliments of Rich Harrington and the crew at RHED Pixel. Watch as they show how to capture the sun as it moves across a rock face in this historic park and then enhance the natural beauty of the time-lapse sequence with dramatic HDR development and toning techniques. Along the way, Rich explains what gear you'll need to capture the scene and protect your camera from the elements, and how to set up your camera to shoot JPEG or RAW, create an in-camera HDR sequence, and add finishing touches in post-production programs like Photomatix Pro, After Effects, and Camera Raw. This course was created and produced by RHED Pixel. We are honored to host this content in our library.
