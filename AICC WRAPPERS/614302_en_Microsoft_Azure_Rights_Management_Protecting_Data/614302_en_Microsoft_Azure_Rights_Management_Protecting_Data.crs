Azure Rights Management offers data security in Office 365. This cloud-based service uses encryption, identity, and authorization policies to help protect user data. What's more, it works across multiple devicesâ€”phones, tablets, and PCs. This course provides an overview of Azure Rights Management, including the business scenarios in which it can be used. Then, through a series of demos, instructor Brian Culp shows how to plan for Azure Rights Management, activate the service, deploy templates in Office 365, and encrypt documents and email.
