[Course_Description]
Companies need to win their customers’ trust and confidence to become the first provider that buyers consider—their “top of mind” choice. Helping your clients altruistically can boost your firm into this high-priority position. In his book Top of Mind, marketing executive John Hall explains how to use the content you produce as an avenue for earning customer trust. This audio-only summary from getAbstract conveys Hill’s key takeaways on how trust plus consistency leads to opportunity. getAbstract believes novice and veteran marketers can benefit from this clear, sensible message about communications, content and confidence. This audiobook summary was created by getAbstract, the world’s largest provider of business book summaries. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
