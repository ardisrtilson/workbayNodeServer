[Course_Description]
Sometimes shapes tell better stories than shadows. A silhouette of a person or object can be a powerfully expressive, graphical representation of a person or scene. Besides, silhouettes can be fun to shoot. In this course, photographer Erika Thornes demonstrates shooting techniques for several kinds of silhouette scenarios, from people to trees and more. She explores the lighting conditions that work best for silhouettes, and shoots several examples. The course concludes with an exploration of post-processing techniques that accentuate shapes and bring out lighting.
