[Course_Description]
A professional with a disability may also have an aptitude for project management, graphic design, or full-stack development. But physical and social barriers in the world of work can make it difficult to fully capitalize on those skills—or worse, prevent them from securing gainful employment at all. Liz Johnson, a Paralympic gold-medalist and founder of The Ability People, seeks to knock down these barriers by helping organizations redefine how they view people with disabilities in the workforce. And in this course, she shares strategies that can help you do the same. Discover how to sidestep conversations that don't serve your colleagues. Learn how to classify the appropriateness of offering assistance. Plus, get tips on how to select the best employee for a role by focusing on the desired outcome of a task—not the methodology. Upon finishing this course, you'll be ready to start creating a more accessible workplace where employees with disabilities are set up to thrive.
