Microsoft Teams offers features tailored to the unique needs of firstline workersâ€”individuals who work in service- or task-oriented roles across industries such as retail, hospitality, travel, and manufacturing. In this course, Nick Brazzi shows managers and firstline employees how to leverage this functionality to efficiently manage work schedules using Teams. Discover how to use the Shifts tool to manage staffing schedules, including how to add staff members to a schedule, build a schedule and set shifts, and schedule time off. Plus, learn how to view schedules on both the desktop and mobile app, request to swap a shift, and properly schedule change requests.
