For many of us who are not financial professionals, worrying about money and saving for the future can be a chore. In this course, financial expert Jane Barratt shows how opportunities arise when you change your attitude towards money. She walks you through the basics of personal finance—earning, spending, saving, and investing—with an eye for finding opportunities to enrich your life. She addresses such questions as: How can you earn more? What are the different types of income? How can you use tax season as a benchmark for planning and goal setting? How do you budget? What is the value of money and what are the smartest approaches for savings and investing? All of this and more is covered in this beginner's course in personal finance.
