[Course_Description]
Project management is key to getting any idea from start to finish, but creative projects face special challenges that set them apart from traditional business projects. In this course, Rich Harrington introduces the core concepts of effective project management as it relates to work in video production, design, photography, or any other creative endeavor. Learn how to describe the services you offer, properly scope your project, identify major deliverables and interdependencies, and communicate with clients at all stages of the process. Rich shares insights from his many years as a business owner and creative professional, bringing together full-time employees, contractors, and freelancers to plan and execute high-level creative projects that keep clients happy.
