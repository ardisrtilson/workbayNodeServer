Looking to earn the Java SE 8 Oracle Certified Associate (OCA) certification? The Oracle Java Certification series was designed to help you prepare to take and pass the qualifying exam for this certification, Java SE 8 Programmer I (1Z0-808). In this course—the second installment in the series—instructor Baochuan Lu focuses on a key topic covered on the test: using operators and decision statements. He covers the use of unary and binary operators; how the if-then-else construct compares to the ternary operator; how to use the enhanced for loop; and more.
