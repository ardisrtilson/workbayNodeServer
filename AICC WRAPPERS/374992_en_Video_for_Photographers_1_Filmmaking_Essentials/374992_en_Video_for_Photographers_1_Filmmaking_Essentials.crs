[Course_Description]
With most current digital cameras and a little training, photographers can start shooting video, quickly expanding their creative options and the range of services they can offer to their clients. In this course, Emmy-winning filmmaker Eduardo Angel helps bridge the gap between photography and film—between still pictures and moving images—by showing what it takes to transition to video. The course covers the most essential video production techniques, from framing and lighting for continuous shots to directing the viewer's attention and incorporating camera movement and sound—Eduardo even provides a brief overview of his post-production workflow. By following along with Eduardo and his team, you'll understand why these concepts are so important and start applying them to your video and hybrid projects right away. Look for the follow-up course, Video for Photographers 02: Filmmaking On Location, where Eduardo shows how these lessons apply to a real-world shoot. Coming soon to the lynda.com library!
