[Course_Description]
The right tools give kids the opportunities to succeed. But in the face of tremendous choice and and fast-paced change, it is hard to judge the right technology for your students. LinkedIn Influencer Betsy Corcoran, cofounder and chief executive of EdSurge, is a former journalist turned expert on education and tech. With EdSurge, she helps teachers, administrators, and parents ask questions that will reveal the ways students are learning and which technology will support their learning goals. Find out where to start, what solutions have worked in other schools, and how to determine costs, get buy-in, and increase utilization. With the right choices, you can build the scaffolding students need to create strong and curious futures for themselves.
