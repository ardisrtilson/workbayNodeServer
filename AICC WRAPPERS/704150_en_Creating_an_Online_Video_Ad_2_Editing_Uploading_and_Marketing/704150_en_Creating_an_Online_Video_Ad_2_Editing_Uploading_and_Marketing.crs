[Course_Description]
Online video ads are essential for advertising any business, no matter how big or small. Video opens up a wider audience and creates an emotional impact that static text and images just can't beat. But what do you do after production is wrapped? How do you edit the raw video into a compelling ad and get it in front of customers? In this course, join veteran video editor Nick Harauz as he takes you through the steps to edit and distribute your online ad through social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. Nick shows how to add polish with effects, graphics, and color correction; export and upload your video to different marketing channels; and measure your video's success and your return on investment. By the end of the course, you'll know how to edit and deliver a polished online video ad of any length or style. Note: This course uses HitFilm Express but the lessons apply equally well to any video-editing software, including Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro. Watch part one of the training for tips on scripting and shooting video.
