[Course_Description]
Typography, done right, can enrich any message, making it beautiful and easy to understand. In this course, Jill Butler distills her many years of teaching and design consulting into 33 laws of typography. These laws are the details that designers can overlook or, in some cases, never learned, but that make for stronger compositions. Here these rules are broken down into five categories: documents, large bodies of text, small blocks of text, punctuation, and typefaces. Dive into any section to start learning how to put these principles into action in your own designs.
