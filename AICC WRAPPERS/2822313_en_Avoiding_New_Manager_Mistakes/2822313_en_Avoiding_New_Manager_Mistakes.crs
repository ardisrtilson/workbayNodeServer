[Course_Description]
Start your first leadership position off right. Learn how to avoid new manager mistakes, in this course adapted from the podcast How to Be Awesome at Your Job. Host Pete Mockaitis interviews the founder of Raise the Bar, Aaron Levy. Aaron is on a mission to transform the manager roleâ€”by empowering each manager with the tools, skills, and training to be leaders of people who unlock the potential of their team. Aaron explains why most managers are great at executing but bad at managing. He explains how you can reverse that trend by improving your listening skills and developing other key habits: asking powerful questions, communicating directly, establishing psychological safety, and providing constructive feedback.
