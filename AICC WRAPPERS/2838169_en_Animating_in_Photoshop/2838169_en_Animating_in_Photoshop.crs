[Course_Description]
Interested in bringing your line drawings to life? With Adobe Photoshop, you can transform your hand-drawn artwork into compelling animations quickly, avoiding complex specialty software with steep learning curves. Learn how to use Photoshop to make your drawings move in this course with veteran animator Dermot O' Connor. Find out how to draw captivating characters with media brushes, clean up your rough drawings, and add color and inking. Dermot then takes you to the timeline where the animation takes place and shows how to draw the keys, or main poses of an animation; breakdowns; and inbetweens. He also shows how to plot arcs to establish timing and spacing. Finally, learn how to adjust the timing of the final animation and render out the results. By the end of this course, you'll be able to harness this popular software to bring your artwork to life. This course was created by Dermot O' Connor. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
