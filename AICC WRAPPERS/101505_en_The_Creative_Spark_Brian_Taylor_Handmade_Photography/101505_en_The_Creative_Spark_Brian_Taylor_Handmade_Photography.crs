[Course_Description]
Gum printing and Photoshop. Light sensitive materials exposed by sunlight, negatives created with an Epson printer. Meet Brian Taylor, a photographer who combines the love of 19th and 21st century processes to create striking images, each a unique masterpiece with a handmade quality. In this installment of The Creative Spark, Brian talks about why he uses historical processes and shows how he combines them with Photoshop and other modern imaging tools. We follow Brian as he creates a digital negative, exposes a print, and then adds additional layers to create a final image.
