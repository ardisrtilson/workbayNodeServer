[Course_Description]
The CompTIA PenTest+ exam, released in July 2018, certifies your abilities as a qualified penetration tester, capable of identifying and exploiting system vulnerabilities. This course prepares you for the first domain—Planning and Scoping—which makes up 15% of the questions on the exam. Planning and scoping is a critical phase. Without a plan, it's easy for pen tests to expand and become more work than you initially thought. Michael Solomon, PhD, explains how to estimate the budget and resources you need to complete testing, ensure you have the proper legal permissions, define the scope of testing, set up your lab environment, and build your threat model, a map that will help guide you through the next steps in your pen test. This Total Seminars course covers the exam certification topics.
