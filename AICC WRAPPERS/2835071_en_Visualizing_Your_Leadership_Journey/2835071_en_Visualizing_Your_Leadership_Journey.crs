[Course_Description]
The first step to leadership is self-awareness. In this hands-on leadership course, instructor Nevada Lane provides an effective and fun way to build self-awareness through visualization. First, Nevada helps you to identify life events that influenced your development and growth as a leader. She asks you to identify people who have inspired you and to articulate the core principles that drive your own leadership approach. Next, Nevada walks you through identifying your leadership strengths and values. She shows you how to state a vision for what you want to create or how you want to be. Then Nevada encourages you to identify a quote that summarizes an aspect of your values, principles, or vision. She has you pull all these pieces together and build a leadership story graphic. In conclusion, she helps you to identify ways to use your leadership journey graphic, including sharing it with others.
