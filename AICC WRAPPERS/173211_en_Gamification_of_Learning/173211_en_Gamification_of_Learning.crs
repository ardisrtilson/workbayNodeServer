[Course_Description]
Gamification is an underutilized element in instructional design, but it's crucial to engaging today's learners and enabling content mastery. In this course, professor, instructional game designer, and author Karl Kapp lays the foundations of the theory, provides examples of gamification in three real-world learning scenarios, and breaks down the dynamics of gamification (aka what makes games fun!): escape, collection, discovery, pattern recognition, and other risk/reward activities. Plus, learn to put the different elements of gamification—from setting goals to providing multidimensional feedback and leveling up—to work for your classroom. If you don't have experience gaming, don't worry. Professor Kapp focuses on gamification as a design sensibility, making the principles clear to gamers and nongamers alike.
