Many creative people are familiar with the frustrating experience of discovering that their work is being used online without their permission. But not all of the artists whose work is being copied and resold know how to properly manage the situation. In this course, Von Glitschka dives into the subject of copyrights, sharing key information that you need to know to protect your work. Von explains what a copyright is, what needs to be copyrighted, and how to register one. He also explores copyright infringement, explaining where it commonly happens and how to know if you're a victim. From there, he and his lawyer take you through the process of responding to infringement, and demystify some common misconceptions about copyright law.
