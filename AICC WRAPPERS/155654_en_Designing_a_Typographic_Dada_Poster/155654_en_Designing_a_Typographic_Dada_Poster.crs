[Course_Description]
The Dada art movement rejected logic and reason, and instead embraced nonsense, irrationality, and disharmony. While the movement did not stand the test of time, Dada's legacy lives on in literature, visual arts, and graphic design. In this installment of Type Project, Nigel French shows you how to resurrect this anti-art style and build a Dada-esque typography treatment. As with the other courses in the series, he shows you how to choose fonts and color palettes appropriate to the time period and how to use Photoshop and Illustrator to recreate the style for a modern age. These techniques include simulating imperfect baselines, creating an overprint effect, and adding texture. Want more inspiration?
