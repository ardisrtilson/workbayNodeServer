Music Memos is a super cool tool for recording high-quality audio on your iPhone or iPad. In this course, author Matt Piper demonstrates how to effectively use Music Memos to record, arrange, edit, and share your musical ideas. He starts by covering automatic and manual recording techniques and how to review, rename, tag, and rate your musical ideas. Then he shows how to add drums and bass, trim the recordings, and add text notes, tuning, and capo positions. Finally, Matt explains how to share the musical ideas via email, iTunes, YouTube, and SoundCloud, and how to transfer the files to GarageBand or Logic Pro.
