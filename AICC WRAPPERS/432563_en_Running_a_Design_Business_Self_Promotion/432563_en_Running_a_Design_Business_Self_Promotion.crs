[Course_Description]
You probably know the names of many design greats. Chip Kidd, Marian Bantjes, Debbie Millman—and Sean Adams. What do they have in common? These designers know how to promote themselves. Self-promotion is essential for freelancers and studio heads alike. Fortunately, there are more and more ways designers, and creatives in general, can get the word out about their businesses, from business cards and Behance, to blogs and design conferences. In this course, Sean takes you through the steps of determining what your design identity is and developing the essential pieces every promotional system needs. He takes a deep dive into some of the more complex and critical components, such as developing an effective and elegant website, and also touches on topics one might not think of—such as writing an effective bio and working with colleges to give back and brand build. Learn how to let the world know who you are and what you do. Start promoting your design career now.
