But finding a sponsor often feels awkward or overwhelming to people just entering the industry—the people who need the support the most. It can be even more challenging for women, who may struggle to find female role models in their fields. This short course—led by best-selling author and technology leader Rashim Mogha—explains how to find a sponsor as a woman in tech. Rashim describes how to identify qualified sponsors, build meaningful relationships, and communicate your goals clearly. Using these tips, you can find a sponsor to partner with on high-impact projects and guide you to new career highs.
