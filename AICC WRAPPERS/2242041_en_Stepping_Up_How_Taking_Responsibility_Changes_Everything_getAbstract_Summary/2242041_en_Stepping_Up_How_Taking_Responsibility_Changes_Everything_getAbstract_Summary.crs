[Course_Description]
Responsibility is the key to change. Find out how to improve your life and make a difference in the world in this audio-only review of John Izzo’s important book. Drawing from his background in leadership, personal development, and corporate culture, Izzo articulates solid theory, practical strategies, and examples of how otherwise ordinary people have stepped up to fill a need, right a wrong, or make things better for themselves and others. Izzo’s compendium of practical ways to take action is very effective. getAbstract recommends this blueprint for change to anyone with a bent for self-improvement. This audiobook summary was created by getAbstract, the world’s largest provider of business book summaries. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
