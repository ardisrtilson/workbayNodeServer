[Course_Description]
Learn the flaws behind three negotiation-related myths: win win, the need for trust, and getting to yes vs. starting with no. In this course, adapted from the American Negotiation Institute podcast Negotiate Anything, Kwame Christian discusses these common negotiation myths with Allan Tsang, negotiation coach and consultant at Oblinger and Tsang, and explores how to use the truth to your advantage. They discuss examples that show why the myths donâ€™t work in real life and address concerns you may have about challenging conventional wisdom. This course was created by the American Negotiation Institute. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
