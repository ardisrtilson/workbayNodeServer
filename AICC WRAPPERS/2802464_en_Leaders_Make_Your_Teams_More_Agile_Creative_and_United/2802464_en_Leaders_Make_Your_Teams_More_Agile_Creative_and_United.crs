[Course_Description]
Volatile. Uncertain. Complex. Ambiguous. Sound familiar? That’s the experience of living and doing business in the 21st century. But because these conditions (VUCA) can trigger fear, businesses and individuals often respond counterproductively—becoming more rigid and hierarchical when what’s needed is agility and adaptability. In this course you can discover techniques to make your teams more agile, creative, and united by learning first hand from NASA astronauts and military veterans like General Stanley A. McChrystal—professionals who are all about responding effectively to VUCA environments. Get tips to structure your organizations and teams to handle rapid change and creatively solve complex problems under impossible conditions. Plus, listen to FutureThink CEO Lisa Bodell explain her toolkit for inspiring agile thinking—including a “wildcards” exercise to encourage your team to skillfully pivot, rather than respond chaotically to change. This course includes videos from: Stanley Allen McChrystal, retired United States Army general Chris Fussell, chief growth officer at McChrystal Group Brent Gleeson, decorated Navy SEAL combat veteran, consultant, speaker, and author Scott Parazynski, US astronaut Lisa Bodell, founder and CEO of FutureThink Note: This course was produced by Big Think.
