In this course, Professor Eddie Davila offers beginner-level lessons, so you too can master the terms, formulas, and techniques needed to perform the most common types of statistics. Eddie covers several examples of data and charts. He explains how to find the middle of your data set, as well as the mean and median.

These techniques help you understand your data, prove theories, and save time, money, and other valuable resourcesâ€”all by understanding the numbers.
