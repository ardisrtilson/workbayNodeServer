[Course_Description]
Learn how to create a looping animation for motion graphics and web design using Adobe Photoshop. Owen Lowery shows how to create animated loops in a variety of styles (including a hand-drawn look) and export them as different file types, suitable for web or video. Along the way, you'll learn how to set up a Photoshop workspace specifically for animation, animate layers in the Timeline, use onion skinning, and add color and texture to your animation. The results are exported as versatile animated GIFs and as video that can be used in other motion graphics programs such as After Effects.
