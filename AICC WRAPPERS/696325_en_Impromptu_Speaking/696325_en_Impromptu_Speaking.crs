[Course_Description]
We are often called on unexpectedly in professional and social situations to deliver an impromptu speech. These moments offer us opportunities to sell an idea, influence a colleague, and make an unforgettable impression. Instead of hoping you do well, take this short course and have some techniques and ideas in your back pocket. Learn why impromptu speaking is so critical to your career, how to use key structural elements to craft a strong impromptu statement, and what to do when you have no time to prepare. This course also covers how to handle special circumstances, such as when you're drawing a blank or dealing with a technical question.
