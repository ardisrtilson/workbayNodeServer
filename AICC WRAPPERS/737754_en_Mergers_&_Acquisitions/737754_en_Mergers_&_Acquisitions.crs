Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) can spark rapid growth and help businesses add promising new capabilities. But while M&A can dramatically boost your company's position in your industry, it's also a highly risky venture. In this course, instructor Mike Figliuolo prepares you to tackle this complex undertaking, stepping through how to best approach each stage of the M&A process. Mike goes over how to assess and approach your M&A target, negotiate the deal, conduct due diligence, finalize the deal, and smoothly integrate the business you acquired.
