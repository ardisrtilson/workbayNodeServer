So you've gone to a lot of hard work to create amazing, handmade motion graphics. Now learn how to reuse and add new life to what you've done. This After Effects training course is the third part in Owen Lowery's series, designed for mograph artists who want a more handmade, DIY aestheticâ€”without giving up their digital toolset. In this installment, you'll learn how to take existing assets, isolate and save out individual elements, dirty them up, and composite them in a single cohesive look. Owen will even assign you a challenge away from the computer that will result in a grungy texture all your own. Start watching and learn how versatile the Adobe After Effects tools can be when you stretch them beyond their traditional uses and employ some creative problem solving.
