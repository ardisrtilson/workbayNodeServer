In this course, Bill Gardner shows you how he pulls together the annual logo Trend Report, demonstrating how to identify trends. Bill explains how trends develop and shares why spotting trends is important to logo designers. He takes you through the process of tracing the evolution of specific trends as examples. This leads to a trained eye that can more readily predict what future paths trends may take. Using this skill, designers gain a distinct edge on the competition.
