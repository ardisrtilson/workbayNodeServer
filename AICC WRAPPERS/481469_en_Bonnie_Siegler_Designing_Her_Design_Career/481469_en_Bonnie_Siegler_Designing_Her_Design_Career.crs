[Course_Description]
Great designers forge their own paths. They break rules. They build lifelong bonds with clients, and they add value to the simplest projects. Bonnie Siegler is a prime example of a designer that has broken the mold successfully. She started in the early days of MTV and went on to found the highly respected design firm, No. 17, right out of her apartment, as well as the equally successful firm Eight and a Half. Along the way, Siegler has designed groundbreaking graphics for iconic brands like Saturday Night Live, Newsweek, and ABC. In this short documentary, Bonnie reflects on her career and explains the skill set (communication, problem solving, and basic business sense) that makes a breakout designer successful. Plus, get an inside look at the design process for the new brand identity she spearheaded for the Brooklyn Public Library.
