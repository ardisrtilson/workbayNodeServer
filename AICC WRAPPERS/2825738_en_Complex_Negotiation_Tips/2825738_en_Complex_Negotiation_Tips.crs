Sometimes foundational skills arenâ€™t enough to manage complex negotiations. There are too many moving parts to broker, too much at stake for a straightforward compromise. Dr. Carolyn Goerner has taught negotiation for 25 years and coached hundreds of people through challenging deliberations. In this course, she combines practical experience with the latest research on managing the most difficult negotiations. Explore best practices in managing multiple negotiation partners, building and maintaining relationships, planning for complicated situations, and developing your professional demeanor. Plus, learn how gender impacts the negotiation process and how you can correct power imbalances on the bargaining table.
