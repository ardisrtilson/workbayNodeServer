[Course_Description]
MainStage 3 turns your computer into an instrument for live performance. It allows you to perform with a laptop, play backing tracks, process vocals, and loop tracks live while accessing the same library of sounds from its sister app, Logic Pro, is known for. Who better to show off this powerful live-performance tool than a professional singer/songwriter? This course features NYC-based musician Julian Velard's original music and his insights on working with MainStage in a real live-performance scenario. Julian begins with a quick-start guide for getting a live show ready. He covers the basic tools of the MainStage interface, including patches, channel strips, in-depth uses of the various inspector areas, MIDI mapping, and MIDI FX. He also explains how to design your own MainStage workspaceâ€”a critical piece of being comfortable on stage. Finally, he demonstrates how to use the Playback and Loopback plugins, as well as record your performances in MainStage.
