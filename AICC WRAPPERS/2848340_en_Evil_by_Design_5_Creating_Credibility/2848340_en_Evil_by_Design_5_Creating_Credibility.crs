[Course_Description]
Have you ever watched a movie you’d never heard of or had any previous interest in, simply because it was the highest grossing movie of the year, or because it won a bunch of awards? These persuasive effects are based on credibility, namely social proof (many people saw the movie) and authority (critics loved it). As people are more likely to trust a source they find credible, creating credibility and trust in your design, brand, or campaign is an essential part of success. In this course, Chris Nodder shows how you can build your credibility and influence users’ behavior through targeted, persuasive design efforts, as well as the use of dark patterns. He covers the different ways you can create credibility—social proof, reciprocation, authority, smart defaults—as well as how to use your newfound credibility and the ethical considerations in doing so.
