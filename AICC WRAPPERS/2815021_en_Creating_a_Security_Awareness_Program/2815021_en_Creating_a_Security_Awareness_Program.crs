[Course_Description]
By implementing a security awareness program, you can turn people into assetsâ€”not fragile targets. A truly robust and mature security program makes educating employees a top priority in a company's overall multilayered approach. In this course, Lauren Zink shows how to develop and implement a successful, ongoing security awareness program that's so much more than just one phishing simulation or an annual required training. True security awareness necessitates year-round, relevant, and tailored training and communications that create an overall cultural shift you can measure. Through this course, discover how to sketch out your program plan, create a budget, leverage creative approaches for keeping your employees engaged, and assess the effectiveness of your program.
