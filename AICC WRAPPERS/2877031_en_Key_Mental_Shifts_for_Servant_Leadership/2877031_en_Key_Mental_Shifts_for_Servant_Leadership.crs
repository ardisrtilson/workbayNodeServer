[Course_Description]
When leaders put profit over their employees, employees become disengaged and underperform. Lower employee morale will, in turn, result in a net loss for the company. But when leaders view themselves as servant leaders and put their employees first, they inspire them to perform better. In this course, adapted from the podcast How to Be Awesome at Your Job, Matt Tenney discusses how mindfulness vastly improves the way we lead and relate with others. Matt outlines three blocks to servant leadership, including messaging from society that teaches us to focus on our goals over our well-being and the well-being of others. He also discusses how to rewire your brain through mindfulness, practice mindfulness as you perform basic tasks in your daily routine, and more. This course was created by Pete Mockaitis of How to Be Awesome at Your Job. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
