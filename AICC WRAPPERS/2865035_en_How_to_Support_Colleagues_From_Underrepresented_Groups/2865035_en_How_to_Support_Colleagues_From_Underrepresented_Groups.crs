[Course_Description]
In this course, author and ally Maxie McCoy shares practical advice for uplifting and supporting marginalized colleagues, especially women. First, Maxie explores how four ways of being generous to your connections yields generosity back, as well as how a scarcity mindset can keep you from supporting others. Maxie then discusses recognizing your own privilege and using it in support of marginalized colleagues. She teaches you that by focusing on what you can uniquely offer, you're able to provide meaningful support, versus overpromising and underdelivering. She lists the three Rs of meaningful support: ritualized, repeatable, and regular interactions. Maxie concludes with a small but impactful challenge that should inspire you to offer support based on where you are now and what you have to give in the moment.
