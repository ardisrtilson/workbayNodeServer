Curious about design thinking? It's the design methodology on everyone's mind. While it's not magic, design thinking can help you save time and find more creative solutions to your customers' needs. Having a good understanding of the process will help you explain the benefits to management and clients and implement design thinking at your organization. In this course, Chris Nodder explains where design thinking fits into product development and what it can help you achieve. He describes each step in the process, from identifying the problem you want to solve and brainstorming solutions, to prototyping, development, and release. Learn about the pros and cons of this approach and how to overcome challenges such as organization inertia and silos. Done right, design thinking can start your organization moving toward broader user-centered design techniques such as information architecture, content testing, usability testing, and marketing research.
