[Course_Description]
Great designers are empaths. They harness the power of emotional response to connect to audiences and inspire action. If you want your designs to move people, you need to understand the role emotion plays in your work. Join Stefan Mumaw for this fun and frank exploration, which probes the human condition for lessons that can be used in any design project: from branding campaigns to product packaging. Stefan explains how emotion, rational thought, and culture impact our reactions to design, and how you can use different choices and tools—layout, typography, color, and more—to trigger different emotions and achieve connection with your brand, product, or service.
