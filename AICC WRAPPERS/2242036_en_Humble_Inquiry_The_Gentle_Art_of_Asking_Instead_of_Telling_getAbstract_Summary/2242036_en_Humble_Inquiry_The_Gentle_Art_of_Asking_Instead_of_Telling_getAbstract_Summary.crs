[Course_Description]
American culture prioritizes action, practicality, and competition over courteousness and respect. But there’s a different way. In his popular book, retired MIT professor Edgar H. Schein encourages openness and curiosity about others in the form of humble inquiry. Humble inquiry is “asking questions to which you do not already know the answer” and “building a relationship based on curiosity and interest in the other person.” This audio-only summary from getAbstract reviews this slim but powerful book, ideal for executives, managers, leaders, and anyone else who wants to know how to ask a polite question—and really wants to know the answer. This audiobook summary was created by getAbstract, the world’s largest provider of business book summaries. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
