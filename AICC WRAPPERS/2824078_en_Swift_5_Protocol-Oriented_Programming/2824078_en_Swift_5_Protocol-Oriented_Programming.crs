[Course_Description]
Take a closer look at protocol-oriented programming (POP), a new paradigm introduced by Apple. In this course, instructor Károly Nyisztor explains what POP is, how it differs from classical approaches, and how to work with it to efficiently develop apps with Swift. Learn about the pillars of POP: protocol extensions, protocol inheritance, and protocol composition. Protocol extensions let you define default behavior for conforming types without defining a base class. Protocol inheritance is a powerful feature that lets you create more granular designs. Swift does not allow multiple inheritance for classes—but with protocol composition, Swift types can adopt multiple protocols. Plus, explore generics, and see how to implement a fully functional app using a protocol-oriented approach.
