[Course_Description]
Over 10,000 infographics are released online everyday, but less than 1% see any real success. To create a successful infographic, you can't combine any text and imagery and call it a day. Infographics aren't just eye candy! It's when designers truly understand the power of visual communication that their infographics break through. Using a few basic design guidelines, they can illustrate big problems in clear language, distill complex ideas, and call attention to overlooked issues. In this course, Amy Balliett, CEO of Killer Infographics, shows members how to create engaging and successful infographics that will stand out from the crowd. She explains the science behind good visual communication, reviews the different types of infographics, and introduces design principles and techniques that will help you build engaging and successful infographics.
