Students need an education that prepares them to be successful in an ever-changing technical world. Teachers can help by transforming their lessons into digital student resources. This course shows educators how to move content into interactive and engaging multimedia presentations for differentiated and flipped learning. Elearning expert Renaldo Lawrence takes a typical lecture-style lesson and breaks down which parts can be transformed into a multimedia project. Renaldo then guides educators through rewriting lesson plans and goals, creating video and audio assets, publishing the project online, and incorporating the new multimedia curriculum into the classroom.
