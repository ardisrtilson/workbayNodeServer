[Course_Description]
Electronic press kits (EPKs) have a distinct look, which comes from the composition but also the color of the shots. In this installment of EPK Editing Workflows, you'll learn how to assess your visuals, control contrast, match shots, and choose a look for your finished edit. Author Maxim Jago shows how to compare in-camera footage with behind-the-scenes material, and make creative choices about blending them together. He also shares some beautiful special effects for adding flair to visuals. The final chapters show you how to put it all together, and make your Adobe CC workflow even more efficient, with presets.
