[Course_Description]
Gone are the days when rewards and recognition could be centered around tangible goods like how many widgets a worker assembled. The knowledge, gig, and global economies require major changes to how leaders recognize and reward workers in ways to drive performance. In this course, behavioral science expert Beck Saltzman shows you how to employ recognition and reward strategies for motivating workers in the modern economy. Learn how to measure the real impact of recognition and rewards, optimize the right kind and avoid the wrong kind of recognition, make rewards personally and culturally relevant, finesse the timing of recognition, and step up your efforts when times are tough. Use these techniques to celebrate your team’s wins and create a culture of recognition—complete with performance dividends—for your entire organization.
