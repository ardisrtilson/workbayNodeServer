[Course_Description]
Because creativity is such a powerful changemaking force, countless myths have sprung up around it, the most dangerous of which is that “you either have it or you don’t.” While some people may be more talented than others in, say, songwriting or costume design, the ability to think and solve problems creatively is built into the human brain. Curiosity, experimentation, and innovation define us as a species. At the same time, we’re creatures of habit, and it’s easy for individuals and companies to get “locked in” to procedures that no longer serve them. How do you get “unstuck”? Building on insights from improv, design thinking, comedy writing, and startup incubation, the lessons in this course offer you concrete tools for creative thinking. This course includes videos from: John Cleese, actor, director, and film producer Bob Kulhan, CEO, Business Improvisations Dave Evans, co-founder of Electronic Arts, lecturer, and co-author of Designing Your Life: How to Build a Well-Lived, Joyful Life Bill Burnett, executive director of the Stanford University design program and co-author of Designing Your Life: How to Build a Well-Lived, Joyful Life Beth Comstock, business executive and author (Imagine It Forward: Courage, Creativity, and the Power of Change) Note: This course was produced by Big Think.
