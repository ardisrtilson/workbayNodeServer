[Course_Description]
Demonstrate your knowledge of PowerPoint by becoming a Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS). This course, created by certified MOS Master Instructor Megan Hoffman, prepares you for exam 77-729. She covers the five main areas of the PowerPoint 2016 MOS exam: creating and managing presentations; inserting and formatting text, shapes, and images; inserting tables, charts, SmartArt, and media; applying transitions and animations; and managing multiple presentations. Megan begins with an overview of the certification program. She then walks through all of the certification objectives, and provides you with downloadable sample documents so you can get hands-on experience with each of the concepts as you go. The course concludes with a full-length practice test that emulates the PowerPoint 2016 MOS exam, together with solutions to each of the exam challenges.
