[Course_Description]
It’s a simple fact of life that at some point, we’ve been harmed or betrayed, and at other times we have betrayed others or ourselves. But one of the greatest gifts of a spiritual life is that of forgiveness. In this audio-only course, mediation expert Jack Kornfield shows how forgiveness can transform your life and release you from the sorrows of the past. Jack’s guided meditation will help you begin the process of forgiveness, helping you process feelings of grief, rage, fear, and confusion. As Jack highlights, once you let yourself feel the pain you carry, forgiveness comes as a sense of relief and frees you from the past, allowing you to move on with your life.
