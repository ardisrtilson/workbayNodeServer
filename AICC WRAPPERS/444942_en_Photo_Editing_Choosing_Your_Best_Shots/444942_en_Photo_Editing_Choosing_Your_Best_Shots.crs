[Course_Description]
Among photo pros, photo editing doesn't mean Photoshopping. Instead, the phrase refers to the process of reviewing a shoot to identify the very best shots. Find out how to choose your best shots, and how to identify what makes one photo better than another similar one. Steve Simon uses examples from his own portfolio—photos shot around the world in locations such as Cuba and India as well as intimate family portraits—to show how professional photographers select their best images. Plus, get tips on strengthening your final shots with cropping and other post-processing techniques.
