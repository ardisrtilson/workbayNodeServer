[Course_Description]
Learn the most efficient way to create interactive animations for web, mobile, and desktop projects with Adobe Animate CC, the newly relaunched version of Flash Professional. This project-based course features two assignments: an animated web banner that responds to mouse movement, touch input, and clicks, and a three-state interactive animation that plays like a game. Joseph Labrecque shows how to set up the Animate workspace, prepare the stage, use both keyframe and procedural-based workflows, create titles, and program interactions. Plus, learn how to integrate both completed animations into a self-contained responsive webpage.
