What exactly does a video producer do? Understanding the role of the modern video producer will help you recognize if you have the skills and the mindset to take on the job. A good producer not only knows video inside and out, but also can manage time and money effectively, resolve conflict, maintain morale, and plan logistics. Above all else, a video producer has to be flexible and able to make decisions quickly, on the fly. Walter Biscardi takes you on set and shows you how production decisions unfold in real time, whether you're scripting, scheduling, directing crew members, or providing feedback to post. Follow along and explore the responsibilities of a producer in all stages, including pre-production (planning), production (running a set), and post-production (editing and delivery). By the end, you'll have a better understanding of skills and techniques it takes to run a smooth and successful video production.
