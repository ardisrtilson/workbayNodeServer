[Course_Description]
Take mandolin lessons online and learn at your own pace. Grammy nominee Mike Marshall teaches the intermediate concepts that will take your mandolin skills to the next level. Get practice exercises to stay motivated and increase your speed and dexterity, and build your repertoire of solo and kickoff material. Mike starts the course with some techniques for keeping your instrument in tip-top shape, including changing the strings and setting the action (aka fret spacing). Then he segues into some intermediate music theoryâ€”keeping things fun and practical by showing examples in action. Next, learn how to play some intermediate mandolin tunes, including blues licks and scales, and practice some finger buster exercises to help refine your finger positioning, stamina, and reach. This course is part two of the Mandolin Lessons series, which includes hundreds of lessons, exclusive performances, and special guest interviews. Make sure to check out the exercise files for downloadable tab, audio samples, and other study materials. Note: This course was created and produced by ArtistWorks. We are honored to host this training in our library.
