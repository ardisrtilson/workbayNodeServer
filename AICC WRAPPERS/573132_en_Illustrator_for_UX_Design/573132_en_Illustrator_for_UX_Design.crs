[Course_Description]
Work smarter and faster with Adobe Illustrator to design your next web or app project, starting with wireframes. Brian Wood shows how, in this course, building upon what you already know—making shapes, working with layers, and using guides—and focusing on the features needed to effectively work with text, symbols, libraries, and a lot more. Brian demonstrates how to set up your artboards and use grids, masks, and styles to fulfill common UX design needs, from organizing content and buttons to making a layout responsive. He concludes by taking you through the export process.
