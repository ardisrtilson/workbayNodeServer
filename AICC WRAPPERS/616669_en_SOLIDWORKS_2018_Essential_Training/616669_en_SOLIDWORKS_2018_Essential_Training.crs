[Course_Description]
SOLIDWORKS 2018 is 3D CAD software that delivers powerful design functionality with an intuitive user interface to speed your design process and make you instantly productiveâ€”enabling you to deliver innovative products to market faster. In this course, Gabriel Corbett teaches you the essential tools and techniques necessary to create parts, assemblies, and drawings efficiently in SOLIDWORKS. First, see how to create two-dimensional sketches that become the foundation for 3D objects. Next, look at extruding and revolving 3D features; creating complex objects using the Sweep, Loft, and Surface tools; and modifying parts. Learn how to create uniform holes with the Hole Wizard, and explore more advanced modeling techniques using equations, mirroring, and pattern tools. Then review best practices for putting parts together in assemblies and building robust structures. The course wraps up tips for creating detailed drawings that relate the final parts and assemblies to a manufacturer, complete with an itemized bill of materials and drawing notes.
