[Course_Description]
Determine the ROI for learning. Discover how to evaluate whether learning objectives are being met in your organization. In this course, Jeff Toister explores several popular models for determining the effectiveness of a class or training course, and provides a framework for applying these models. This includes creating an evaluation strategy, collecting assessment data, and making recommendations for improvements. The Kirkpatrick Model, the Phillips ROI Methodology, and Brinkerhoff's Success Case Method are discussed in depth, as well as alternative approaches such as predictive analytics. These tools will give you the data to validate your current training strategy or recommend data-driven improvements that are tailored to the way your participants are actually learning. Check the exercise files for sample evaluation plans, reports, checklists, and worksheets that you can use to evaluate your own employee development program.
