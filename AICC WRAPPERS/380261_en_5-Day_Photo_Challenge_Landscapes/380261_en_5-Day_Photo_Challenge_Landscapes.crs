[Course_Description]
How do you get better at photography? By challenging yourself every day. Justin Reznick offers a variety of creative and technical challenges that encourage you to get out of your chair—and your comfort zone—and start taking better landscape photos. Learn to work the golden hour, incorporate tools such as filters and medium-length lenses, shoot iconic landscapes in new, intimate ways, and find a different perspective by moving your feet. Justin offers his own solution for each challenge, so you can see how a master photographer tackles the same subject. Make sure to share your results with Justin and other fellow photographers on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook using the hashtag #5DayPhoto.
