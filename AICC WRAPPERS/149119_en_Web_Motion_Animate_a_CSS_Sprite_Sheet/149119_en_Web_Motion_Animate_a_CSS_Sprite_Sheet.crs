[Course_Description]
CSS sprite sheets have opened up another door for web motion, allowing you to efficiently animate a series of imagesâ€”anything from button states to character poses. In this quick course, Tom Green shows you how to animate a character's walk cycle by creating a sprite sheet in Flash, editing in Fireworks, and putting it into motion (and into your HTML) with Edge Animate.
