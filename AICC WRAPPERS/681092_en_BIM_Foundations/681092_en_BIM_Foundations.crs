[Course_Description]
The building information modeling (BIM) process involves generating and managing digital models of a place's physical and functional characteristics. BIM files can be exchanged to support decision-making between architects, owners, engineers, and contractors. BIM technologies are used by individuals, businesses, and government agencies who plan, design, construct, operate, and maintain diverse physical infrastructures, including water, electricity, gas, communication, and roads. In this course, gain foundational knowledge by first exploring the principles of BIM and the role it plays in modern architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) projects. Then, learn about the benefits of BIM on a financial and investment level. Finally, see real-world examples of BIM usage.
