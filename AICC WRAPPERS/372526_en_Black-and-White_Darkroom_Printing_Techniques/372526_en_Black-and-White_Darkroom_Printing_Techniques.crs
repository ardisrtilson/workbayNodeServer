[Course_Description]
Once you've shot and processed a few rolls of black-and-white film, the next step you can take to explore analog photography is printing that film in your own darkroom. In this course, a follow-up on his Shooting and Processing Black-and-White Film course, photographer Konrad Eek introduces the fundamentals of black-and-white darkroom printing. First Konrad provides a tour of his own darkroom space, and introduces the key ingredients that dictate how pictures print: paper, exposure, and contrast. He checks a series of images by developing initial test prints, and then explores options for refining the images in the darkroom via cropping, burning and dodging, and adjustments to the development time. When he's finished making prints, Konrad shows how to clean up the darkroom and introduces different paper choices and resources for black-and-white film photographers to explore.
