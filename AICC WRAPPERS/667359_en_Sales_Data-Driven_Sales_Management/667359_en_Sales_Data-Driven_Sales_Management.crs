[Course_Description]
There has been a shift in modern management thinking. Managers are no longer relying on gut feelings and unquantifiable milestones, but on measurable activity and progress. Data-driven management helps sales managers understand what their teams are doing and where they stand, and helps salespeople understand how they can succeed within the organization. It can improve prospecting, boost customer retention, and help managers track performance. Best of all, a data-driven approach works well for companies of all sizes and industries. In this course, Noah Fleming defines data-driven sales management, and shows how to use it to start a conversation with your team and drive results. He also reviews the perils and pitfalls of data collection, and the importance of starting now.
