In this installment of the Test Automation with Python, the focus turns from automation to testing. Learn what it means to think like a tester and how to design and run tests on the automation youâ€™ve created with Appium. Key topics covered include knowing what to test so you can run your tests more efficiently, setting up a test runner, working with the page object model, and testing the capabilities of your app on multiple platforms.
