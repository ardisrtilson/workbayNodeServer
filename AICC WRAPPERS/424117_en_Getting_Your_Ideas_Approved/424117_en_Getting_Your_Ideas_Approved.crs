[Course_Description]
Pitching a big idea can be a daunting prospect if you're unsure where to start. Gathering data and presenting facts isn't always sufficient. Leadership consultant Mike Figliuolo knows how to help you turn the ideas in your head into clear and compelling proposals. His Structured Thought and Communication method is designed to help you clearly articulate the value of your big idea and align it with the needs of stakeholders. While going through the method, you'll get to see how to build an architecture for your idea, create a story that highlights the benefits of your idea, and identify the data that helps prove the value of your idea. By the end of this course, you'll be ready to define, test, and communicate your idea to get the support and buy-in you seek. This course is based on Mike's highly successful Structured Thought and Communication instructor-led training and his book, The Elegant Pitch: Create a Compelling Recommendation, Build Broad Support, and Get it Approved.
