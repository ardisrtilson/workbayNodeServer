[Course_Description]
With so much information on consumers available these days, traditional, large-scale market segmentation strategies just won’t cut it anymore. Many consumers defy categorization and each person is, literally, a market of one. In this audio-only course, Michael Solomon teaches how to connect with these consumers who defy categorization, consumers he calls “new chameleons.” As Michael explains, today’s consumers don’t distinguish between young and old, male or female, sellers or buyers, or even fantasy and reality. He shows the benefits of moving away from painting customers with broad strokes and taking a more nuanced and detailed approach that captures identity changes that take place almost every day. After this course, you’ll be ready to throw out the traditional marketing dichotomies and embrace the postmodern consumer who doesn't conform to traditional categories.
