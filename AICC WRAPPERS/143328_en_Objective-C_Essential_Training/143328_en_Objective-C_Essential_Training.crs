[Course_Description]
There are a lot of programming languages out there, but Objective-C is the best choice for developers who want to develop iOS and OS X apps. This course is your primer. Get the tools you need, learn the structure of Objective-C, and get your first code up and running. Author Simon Allardice also walks you through the Foundation framework, a collection of prewritten code that makes the coding process easier; shows you how to design and build your own classes; and provides memory management techniquesâ€”the key to efficient programming. Plus, learn how to make your way around Xcode 5, the app to write, test, and debug Objective-C, and into advanced features like categories, protocols, and dynamic typing.
