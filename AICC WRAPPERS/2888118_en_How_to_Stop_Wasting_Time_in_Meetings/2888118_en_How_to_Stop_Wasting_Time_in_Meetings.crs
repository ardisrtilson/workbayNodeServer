[Course_Description]
Does anyone love meetings? Let's face itâ€”meetings have a bad reputation, and we probably all know why. They can waste time, add confusion, and lack clear takeaways. The good news is that they don't have to be this way. In this course taught by creativity-productivity expert Samantha Bennett, Sam explains the various ways in which you can make meetings more impactful. She walks through how you can set a clear meeting purpose based on the stakeholders and the type of meeting, and how to get aligned on a direction and ensure all voices and perspectives are heard. She also imparts her rules for effective meetings, how to follow up, and how to hold folks accountable after your meeting. If you take the time to watch this course, you might just find yourself making more of your time in your next meeting. This course was created by Madecraft. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
