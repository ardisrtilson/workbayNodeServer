[Course_Description]
Selenium is one of the most popular tools for testing web-based applications. It allows QA engineers to write and automate tests across many different browsers and operating systems, without a special scripting language. This course introduces Selenium to new users, covering installation and basic use cases. Find out how to set up the test-writing framework, WebDriver, and Selenium Grid, which allows you to distribute the testing load and run tests against a remote server. Learn best practices to write effective tests using variables and functions, and to organize tests into suites that can scale over time. Instructor Meaghan Lewis—a QA engineer at GitHub—also explains the test pyramid paradigm, which details an ideal way to balance unit, integration, and UI testing.
