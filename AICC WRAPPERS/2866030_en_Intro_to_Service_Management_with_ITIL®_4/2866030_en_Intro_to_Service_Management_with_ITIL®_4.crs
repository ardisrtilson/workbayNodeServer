[Course_Description]
The ITIL® framework was designed to help all organizations, regardless of their industry or business sector, provide IT services using the most efficient and economical methods. This course was designed to introduce you to the concepts of service management and the ITIL® 4 framework to help you determine if studying for the ITIL® 4 Foundation certification is right for you. Instead of providing an in-depth look at each of the exam objectives, instructor Jason Dion provides a high-level overview of the ITIL® concepts and practices. If you continue onwards and obtain your certification, you can show employers that you understand the key elements, concepts, and terminology used in ITIL, including how operations move between each activity and process to create value in the service value system, and their overall contribution to the service management best practices.
