He discusses the importance of motion tracking and gets hands on, showing how to track and solve a shot using the C4D Motion Tracker. He also covers exporting and importing data in various industry-standard formats, creating materials, and lighting 3D shots. Plus, Andy shows how to break apart objects with Voronoi Fracture and set up and composite multipass renders.
