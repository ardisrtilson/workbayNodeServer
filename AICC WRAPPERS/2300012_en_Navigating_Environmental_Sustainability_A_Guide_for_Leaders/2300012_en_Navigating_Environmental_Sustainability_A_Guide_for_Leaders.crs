[Course_Description]
Regardless of industry, the global business sector is being transformed around a common issue: environmental sustainability. Business leaders around the world are grappling with meaningful efforts to address climate issues relevant to their organizations. In this course, the chief environmental officer at Microsoft, Dr. Lucas Joppa, discusses some of the most pressing questions surrounding this critical topic. Dr. Joppa frames this course not around a set of rigid rules companies should follow, but through methods for individual companies to evaluate what strategies fit best and how to leverage existing strengths to make the biggest impact. By following just a few of the key principles and concepts Dr. Joppa lays out, companies can ensure that they are not only prepared for the business transformations that lie ahead, but are key architects of it, leading the way on a vital issue.
