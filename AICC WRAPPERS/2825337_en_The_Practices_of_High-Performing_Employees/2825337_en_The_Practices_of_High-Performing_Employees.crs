Learn how performance is always a function of three things: talent, motivation, and support. Discover the five fundamental skills of high performers, including developing the ability and the tenacity to create focus, knowing how to prepare your team for battle, and creating a climate for high performance. Clint also describes his STOP method for higher performance: Sit. Think. Optimize. Perform. This course was created by Pete Mockaitis of How to Be Awesome at Your Job.
