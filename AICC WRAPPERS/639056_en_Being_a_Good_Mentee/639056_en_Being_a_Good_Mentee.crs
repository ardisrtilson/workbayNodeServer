[Course_Description]
Connecting with a network of mentors is critical to your career development. Mentoring is proven to help professionals feel more engaged, derive more meaning from their careers, and get more raises and promotions. But mentees who get the most value from mentoring are prepared. They know what they want, who to contact, and what to do to build a mentoring relationship that lasts. In this course, mentoring expert Ellen Ensher explains how to research and connect with potential mentors, and provides tips for developing successful relationships. She introduces courage rituals to gain the confidence you need to reach out to mentors and meet the challenges they pose. She also provides guidance to overcome common obstacles, and handle diverse mentoring relationshipsâ€”such as cross-gender or cross-cultural relationships.
