[Course_Description]
Learning management systems are transforming the way companies train their workers and the way teachers educate their students. Administrators can assign and grade work online. Users can access content and resources anytime, inside or outside the classroom or office. A learning management system (LMS) can also improve communication, help you track progress, and reduce costs. If you're considering an LMS for your company or school, this is the course for you. LinkedIn Learning instructor Oliver Schinkten explains what an LMS is, what the leading platforms are, and how to choose an LMS system based on learning needsâ€”understanding there are very different use cases for corporate and academic learners. He also covers the basics of administering and configuring an LMS, so you can make an informed decision about your corporate training or academic needs.
