[Course_Description]
Adobe After Effects has been developed continuously for over 20 years now, meaning there are a lot of potentially useful tricks, shortcuts, and features hiding in there that you might not be aware of. Chris and Trish Meyer have used After Effects since version 1.0, making them the perfect duo to unearth these gems, polish them off, and share them with you. But this isn't some trivia contest; these are features you can put to work to save you time and learn more about what this deep motion graphics and visual effects program can do. Features that have been lurking for years will be intermixed with new ones introduced in the latest releases.
