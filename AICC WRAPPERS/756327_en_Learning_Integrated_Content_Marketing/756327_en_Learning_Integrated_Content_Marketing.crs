[Course_Description]
Content marketing can benefit an entire organization. To maximize its impact, it should be integrated across the company: from customer service to the C-suite. Learn what it takes to get other teams to embrace content marketing and use it to achieve shared goals: better employee engagement, increased sales, and a seamless customer experience. Consultant Brian Honigman—a marketing advisor to organizations such as NATO and Samsung—helps you optimize your content for search, adapt it for sharing on social media, and use content to support your efforts across paid advertising, mobile app development, SMS and email campaigns, and more. Then he helps you integrate with public relations, internal communications, leadership, sales, customer services, and human resources to create a cohesive content marketing strategy that breaks down the silos of traditional marketing for true cross-functional success.
