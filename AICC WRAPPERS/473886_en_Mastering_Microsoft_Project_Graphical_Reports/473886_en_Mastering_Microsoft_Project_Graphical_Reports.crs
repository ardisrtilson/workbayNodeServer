[Course_Description]
Reports are key to keeping projects on track and communicating with team members. But it's much easier to understand the data with visual aids like charts and graphs. Fortunately, Microsoft Project has many powerful data visualization tools built right in. Follow along with project management expert John Riopel as he shares his tips for creating graphical reports in Microsoft Project. He walks through building a team status report, a report to deliver to executive stakeholders, a project management report center, and a project performance dashboard. Building these examples will teach you how to master the built-in reports in Microsoft Project and develop more customized reports with the Report Designer tool. Note: This course was designed in collaboration with author Bonnie Biafore. You can follow along with this course using Microsoft Project 2010, 2013, or 2016 and either the free or premium versions of the exercise files.
