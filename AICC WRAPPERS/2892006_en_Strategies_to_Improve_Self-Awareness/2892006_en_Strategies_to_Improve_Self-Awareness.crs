Self-awareness is the secret sauce you can use in achieving success in your career and relationships. It ties into your ability to be confident, exhibit emotional intelligence, and demonstrate understanding, and it is a skill that you can practice and develop. In this course, executive coach Dr. Joel Pérez explains what self-awareness is, what obstacles may challenge you in building self-awareness, and how to overcome those obstacles. He concludes with a detailed discussion of several ways that self-awareness can benefit your life, including personal improvement, communication, stress management, and more.
