[Course_Description]
Unconventional music requires unconventional recording techniques. Sylvia Massy has helped artists such as Tool and Prince realize their own unique sound and vision, using an engineer's mainstays—a recording studio and mixing board—along with some extraordinary gear. In this short documentary, Sylvia shares some of her most infamous recording experiments, from piano demolition to potato filters, and her new favorite tools, including the custom plugins she's developing for Waves.
