[Course_Description]
Get a glimpse behind the studio curtain and see music recording secrets in action. Producer/engineer and Tape Op magazine founder/editor Larry Crane takes you inside of his Jackpot! Recording Studio in Portland, Oregon, and demonstrates the recording techniques he has used when working with musicians such as She & Him, The Decemberists, Elliott Smith, Jenny Lewis, The Go-Betweens, and Sleater-Kinney. This course is a rare opportunity to learn practical techniques from a celebrated audio engineer. First, Larry introduces basic signal flow techniques that will improve any recorded sound. Then he explains some of his recording secrets, like how to capture acoustic guitars and vocals at the same time, how to choose the best microphone for a vocalist, and how to use stereo mics and room placement to create an ensemble sound on a single performer.
