[Course_Description]
Learn how to stop stressing. Maxie McCoy advises dropping the grand plan of your life in favor of simpler questions to move you forward, in this course adapted from the podcast How to Be Awesome at Your Job. Maxie is a writer and speaker obsessed with giving women the tools they need to believe in themselves. As she explains, you don’t have to know where you’re going in order to begin your journey. You just need to find a way to tap into your deep beliefs and desires in order to take one small step after another. Maxie introduces two exercises for discerning your direction, and a simple daily activity for keeping a gratitude journal. Plus, learn how to enroll your support network in your journey by asking them five wise questions. This course was created by Pete Mockaitis of How to Be Awesome at Your Job. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
