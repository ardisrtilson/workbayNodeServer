[Course_Description]
Forget landscape photography—it's time to try shooting seascapes. Wide-angle underwater photography enables you to capture the broad vistas of undersea life. In this course, Deke McClelland and master diver and professional underwater photographer Hergen Spalink take you below the surface to explore the creative options, gear, and techniques behind wide-angle underwater photography. Learn how to adjust strobe strength, aperture, and ISO with in-camera histograms; capture blended and contrasted images; expertly light underwater scenes; and distinguish your photos from the rest of the pack by capturing sunballs, rays of light, and over–unders. Plus, get an introduction to close-focus wide-angle techniques for producing even more attention-grabbing compositions.
