[Course_Description]
The protection of user privacy and data is a clear mandate for business success. In this course, learn how to protect your Django web app using essential security and authentication measures. Using a sample project—a pre-built Django web app and a REST API for that web app—instructor Rudolf Olah shows how to add code that keeps your app safe from cyberattacks. Discover how to add SMS two-factor authentication, set up per-object permissions, and leverage per-group permissions to allow groups of users to access, modify, and delete data. Plus, learn how to create audit logs for compliance, implement zero-knowledge encryption, write a unit test to ensure that server data is fully encrypted for a user, and more.
