[Course_Description]
Your stakeholders—individuals with a vested interest in your project's results—might not be present in your day-to-day work. But since they ultimately impact your project's outcomes, knowing how to define who your stakeholders are and what they need is integral to your success as a project manager. In this course, learn how to identify stakeholder needs and expectations, both explicit and implicit, and build and sustain stakeholder engagement. Natasha Kasimtseva begins by detailing the measurable benefits related to successful stakeholder management. She then explains how to iteratively identify your own stakeholders; analyze and evaluate stakeholders using both emotional intelligence and data representation tools; and engage in service-based thinking as a leader.
