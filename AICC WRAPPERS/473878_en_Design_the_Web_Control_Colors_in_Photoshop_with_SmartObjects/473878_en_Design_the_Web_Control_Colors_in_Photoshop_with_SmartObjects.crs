[Course_Description]
Optimize your web graphics workflow. Learn how to use Photoshop Smart Objects to efficiently manage your project's colors. This project takes a simple color swatch, converts it to a Smart Object, and adds clipping masks, transparency, blend modes, and gradients to create a complex, one-click color adjustment you can use to color text, shapes, images, and more. Because it's smart, you can recolor objects instantly by making a single change to the underlying Smart Object. Download the free exercise files and join Chris Converse in this episode of Design the Web to learn this quick, timesaving technique.
