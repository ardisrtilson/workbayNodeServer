Strategic planning is key to successful business development. If you plunge forward without clearly defining your goals and how you’ll meet them, you run the risk of misplacing your energy and failing to make the kind of progress you envisioned. In this course, Meridith Powell shares how to use strategic planning to work smarter as you develop your business. Learn how to clearly define the long-term goal you want to accomplish, build your strategic planning team, and create a vision, mission, and purpose statement. Plus, learn how to create strategic initiatives, implement your plan, and assess the progress that you’re making (or not making) towards your goals.
