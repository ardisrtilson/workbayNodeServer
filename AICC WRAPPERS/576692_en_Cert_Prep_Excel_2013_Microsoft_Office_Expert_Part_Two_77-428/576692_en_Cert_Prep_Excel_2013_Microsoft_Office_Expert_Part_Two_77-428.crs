Make evident your advanced knowledge of Excel by becoming a Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) Expert. This course, created by Microsoft Certified Trainer Jennifer McBee, helps you prepare for the Excel 2013 Expert Part Two exam, the second part of a two-part exam.

In the managing workbooks chapter, learn how to work with templates, versions, and macros. In the formatting and layout chapter, see how to apply custom formats and styles. The advanced formula chapter covers additional functions including a nested IF. The charts and tables chapter shows how to create a new PivotChart. The course concludes with a sample exam you can use for practice.
