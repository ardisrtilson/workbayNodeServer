[Course_Description]
Presentations don't have to be linear: slide after slide, bullet point after bullet point. With Prezi, you can create eye-catching, impactful presentations that allow you to connect multiple ideas on a single canvas and zoom in and out as your presentation flows. In this course, instructor Garrick Chow acquaints you with the hallmarks of the Prezi style and explains how to plan your presentation before you create it. He shows how to build a new Prezi with Prezi Present and add content like text, images, and shapes. Garrick then shows how to arrange the elements on your canvas for maximum impact and integrate multimedia and animation. Next, you’ll see how to record or stream your presentations with Prezi Video, and how to apply the skills you’ve learned to Prezi Design and build eye-catching and interactive data graphics.
