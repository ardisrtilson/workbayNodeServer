[Course_Description]
The transition of services from the client to the outsourcer is the first, most significant moment of truth in an outsourcing engagement, and it’s more difficult than most people realize. Stumbling blocks abound. In this course, instructor Bob McGannon discusses the overall approach to successful transitions, how to handle personnel transitions, and when the client should keep critical skills in house. He goes over the human factors that you’ll need to manage during transitions, along with how to work with remote and overseas personnel. He reviews the complications of transferring assets and managing service levels during the transition period. Bob talks about the conditions for declaring the transition a success, and then he concludes with a case study exercise to evaluate possible approaches to a transition.
