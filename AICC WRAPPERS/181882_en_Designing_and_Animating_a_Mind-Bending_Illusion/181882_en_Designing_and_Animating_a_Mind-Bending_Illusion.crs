[Course_Description]
Learn what it takes to design your own mind-bending illusion, in this installment of Designs dekeConstructedâ€”the series that breaks down popular graphic designs and show you how to re-create them on your own. Deke starts out by drawing an impossible Penrose triangle and a golden ball in Adobe Illustrator. Next, he plots a path for the ball to follow around the triangle. Last, he moves to Photoshop, where he shows you how to animate the ball with a combination of layer masks and the timeline.
