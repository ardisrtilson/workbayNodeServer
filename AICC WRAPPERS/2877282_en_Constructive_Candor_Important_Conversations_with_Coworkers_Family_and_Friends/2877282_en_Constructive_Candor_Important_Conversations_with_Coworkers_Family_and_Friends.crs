[Course_Description]
No matter who you are, there’s probably someone you’re afraid to talk to and something you’re afraid to talk about. Instructor Drew Kugler endeavors to change that with this course. Part of living a life is having important, tough conversations—with your family, your friends, and your coworkers. Despite this, it seems most efforts to have these conversations go poorly or, worse, don’t happen at all. In this course, Drew shares frameworks and mindsets to create a conversational environment where you can openly share your truth, do so in a caring and constructive way, and compellingly invite others to do the same. Constructive candor builds more meaning, trust, and respect in your most important relationships. Note: This course was created by Drew Kugler. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
