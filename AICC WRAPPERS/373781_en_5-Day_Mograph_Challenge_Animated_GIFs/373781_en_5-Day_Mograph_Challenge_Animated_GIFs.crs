[Course_Description]
Improve your mograph skills one day at a time with this 5-day motion graphics challenge. Author EJ Hassenfratz asks artists to create a different animated GIF each day for 5 days in a row. These challenges are designed to get your creative juices flowing and help you work out of any creative rut. Turn creating into a daily habit—for at least 5 days—and then post your work to Facebook and Twitter using the hashtag #5dayMograph. You can also submit your work to our Tumblr page at 5daymograph.tumblr.com.
