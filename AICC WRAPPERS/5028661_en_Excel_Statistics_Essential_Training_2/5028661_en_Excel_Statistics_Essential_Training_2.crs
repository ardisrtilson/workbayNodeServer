[Course_Description]
Data isn’t valuable until you put it to good use. Statistics transforms data into meaningful information, enabling organizations to make better decisions and predictions. That’s why statistics—collecting, analyzing, and presenting data—is a valuable skill for anyone in business or academia. This course, part two of a series, continues your training on the fundamentals of descriptive and inferential statistics. Dr. Joseph Schmuller teaches you how to use the tools in Microsoft Excel—statistical functions, 3D maps and charts, the Ideas tool, and the Analysis Toolpak add-on—to carry out more sophisticated statistical analysis. First, learn to visualize sampling distributions. Next, test differences with analysis of variance (ANOVA). Then, find out how to use linear, multiple, and nonlinear regression to analyze relationships between variables and to make predictions. Joe also shows how to perform advanced correlations, test hypotheses about frequencies, and create and run simulations. Once you complete both courses, you should have the foundational knowledge to ace your next exam or interview and perform statistical analyses in the workplace.
