[Course_Description]
Node.js apps are known for their blazing-fast speed, but hard-to-find bugs and suboptimal processes can drag performance down. Isolating the problem in the stack can often grind productivity to a halt. In this course, Node.js developer Jon Peck shows how to debug and speed up your site as he walks through how to fix a complete—but flawed—rock-paper-scissors game. Jon shows how to log problems, debug issues, measure performance, implement caching, and continuously optimize your application for performance.
