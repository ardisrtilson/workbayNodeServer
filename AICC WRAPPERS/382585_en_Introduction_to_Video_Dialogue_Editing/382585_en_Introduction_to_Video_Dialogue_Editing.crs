[Course_Description]
Introduction to Video Dialogue Editing explores the history of dialogue in film and introduces a workflow for effective editing of dialogue-based scenes. Staff author Ashley Kennedy breaks the workflow down into four steps: reviewing the script and footage, assembling the project's foundation, refining transitions and timing, and adding finishing touches such as sound, effects, and color correction. She then edits three case studies using scripts with identical dialogue. Combining the dialogue editing strategies from the course with the power of performance, Ashley produces three completely different final cuts.
