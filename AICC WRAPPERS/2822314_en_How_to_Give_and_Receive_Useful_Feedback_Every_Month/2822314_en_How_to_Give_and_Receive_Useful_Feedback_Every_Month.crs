[Course_Description]
The current feedback model is broken. Most employees don’t feel that their annual review is fair or accurate. Craig Dowden exposes gaps in common performance review practices and presents an empowering alternative approach everybody can use–no matter where you work—in this course adapted from the podcast How to Be Awesome at Your Job. Learn what not to do when delivering feedback, and find out how to transition from feedback provider to feedback facilitator. Craig also recommends a monthly “do-it-yourself” performance review for its various fundamental benefits. Plus, learn why more progressive organizations are separating raises, promotions, and compensation from performance review conversations and are moving toward a check-in type of process. This course was created by Pete Mockaitis of How to Be Awesome at Your Job. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
