[Course_Description]
Companies like Uber and Airbnb have ushered in a new type of labor force where the terms employee and employer take on new meaning. To fill these on-demand jobs, HR departments need to become proficient at recruiting and managing a pool of rotating outside workers. Professor and HR expert Wayne Cascio outlines the HR and management challenges brought about by companies working with on-demand workers. Wayne first outlines the characteristics of freelancers, contractors, and elancers, and what they look for in an employer. He then reviews the management challenges involved in leading an on-demand team, and the implications for HR professionals responsible for developing a global supply chain of talent. He also considers critical legal issues: how to protect proprietary information, how to avoid violations of compensation and benefits laws, and how to distinguish nonemployees from employees of an organization. By the end of this course, you'll have a better understanding of the issues facing employers and employees in the on-demand economy.
