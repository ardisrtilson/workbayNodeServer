[Course_Description]
Build PHP applications the modern way with Symfony 4, a popular PHP model-view-controller (MVC) framework. In this course, Mike Oram steps through how to build a PHP-based web app in Symfony. He explains how to install and configure Symfony and start saving time with typical development tasks, such as rendering content with templates. Mike also goes over how to create services with the service container, work with data using the Doctrine object-relational mapper, and implement middleware. After wrapping up this course, you'll have the tools you need to leverage Symfony to get a head start on your PHP projects.
