Microsoft Teams is the communication and teamwork hub of Office 365. Teams brings together the conversations, files, and meetings that team members collaborate on togetherâ€”making it an ideal tool for managing projects. In this course, Microsoft Certified Trainer, Microsoft MVP, and project manager Heather Severino walks through everything you need to know to manage small- to medium-sized projects in Teams. Heather starts by showing how to set up a team and manage permissions. She then covers how to manage files, connect SharePoint lists and pages, take notes, manage online meetings, and collect project feedback. Plus, Heather explains how to be even more efficient in Teams by using keyboard shortcuts and leveraging existing teams as templates.
