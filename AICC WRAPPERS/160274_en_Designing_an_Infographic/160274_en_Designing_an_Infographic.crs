[Course_Description]
Make your data beautiful; turn it into an infographic. Infographics make complicated information easily understandable and visually compelling. In this course, Nigel French memorializes the soldiers and events of World War I, but you can use these lessons to build almost any kind of infographic. Learn how to use Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, and Excel together to analyze and chart the data, plot locations on a map, and build a timeline that simply details a complex sequence of events. Along the way, Nigel explains how to choose fonts and color, create a background image, and finally convert your print graphic into a format suitable for websites.
