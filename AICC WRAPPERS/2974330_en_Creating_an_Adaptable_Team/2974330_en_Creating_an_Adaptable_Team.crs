One thing is for certain: Your organization will constantly be changing. It's inevitable. Individuals and teams that adapt to change can position themselves to act on opportunities. In this course, you can learn how to build more adaptable teams. First, learn about complexity and ambiguityâ€”and see just how easy it is to give in to chaos and being overwhelmed. However, instructor Timothy Smith offers solutions, showing how to build a flexibility, growth, and courage mindset. Finally, find out how to improve your critical thinking skills and become a better conflict manager. This course was created by Madecraft. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
