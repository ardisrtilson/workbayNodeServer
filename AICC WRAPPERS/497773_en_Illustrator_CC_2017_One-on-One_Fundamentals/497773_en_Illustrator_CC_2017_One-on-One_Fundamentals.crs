[Course_Description]
Design and create amazing works of art using the powerful vector-based drawing program—Adobe Illustrator. This comprehensive training is the first in a series of three courses by industry pro Deke McClelland. Learn how to create multipage documents with artboards; how to draw anything you can imagine with the Pen, Pencil, and Curvature tools; and how to start adding color to your artwork with swatches. Deke also covers drawing shapes, adjusting strokes, formatting text, and painting digitally, with or without a tablet. Each chapter should leave you with a new set of skills—and a sense of accomplishment. As Creative Cloud evolves, this course gets updated. Check back for new movies, new feature reviews, and new ways to work.
