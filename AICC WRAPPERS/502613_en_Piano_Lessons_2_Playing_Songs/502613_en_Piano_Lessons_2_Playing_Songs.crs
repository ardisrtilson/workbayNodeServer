[Course_Description]
Learn how to play piano while you learn how to perform classics from the catalogs of great composers such as Strauss, Beethoven, and Chopin. Music professor and acclaimed accompanist Hugh Sung has created a comprehensive video library of piano lessons and clear, over-the-shoulder shots of performances of classic tunes. Watch at your own pace as Hugh breaks down classics like Spring Dance, Blue Danube Waltz, Ode to Joy, and Minute Waltz. Each song is demonstrated at different tempos, so you can slowly increase your pace as you get more comfortable at the keyboard, and overlaid with notation, so you can read each line of music as it's taught. With this training, all levels of pianists learn to play the music they love! Hugh's enthusiasm for piano is contagious and his lessons emphasize learning to play popular songs using a step-by-step method that any level of player can follow. Note: This course was recorded and produced by ArtistWorks. We are honored to host this training in our library.
