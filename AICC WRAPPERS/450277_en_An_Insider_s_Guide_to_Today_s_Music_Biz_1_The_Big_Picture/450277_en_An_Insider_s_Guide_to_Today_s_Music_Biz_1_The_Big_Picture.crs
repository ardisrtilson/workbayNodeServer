[Course_Description]
If you are looking to do something big in the music business, something great, getting your head around the big picture is one of the most important elements of success. It's not about marketing and promotion, how to make records, how to book a tour, or how to manage your social media. Those are all important pieces of the puzzle if you want to be successful. But it's been Steve Rennie's experience—from working in the music biz over 36 years—that if you can understand how the music business works, what's really important, then the rest of the pieces will fall in line. This course kicks off An Insider's Guide to Today's Music Biz, a series of 9 courses designed to teach the ins and outs of the music business to bands, managers, and songwriters. Here, Steve provides tips on assessing your talent, committing to a plan, picking partners, figuring out financials, finding ideas, and surviving in what can be a tough business. Steve's experience, and his honest take on the ups and downs of the industry, will help anyone interested in breaking through be better prepared for the realities of getting by in the music biz.
