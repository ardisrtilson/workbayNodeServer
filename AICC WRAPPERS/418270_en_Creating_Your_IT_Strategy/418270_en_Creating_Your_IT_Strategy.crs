[Course_Description]
The role of information technology (IT) in organizations has changed dramatically. While historically the role of IT departments has been to support business functions, now they can make their organizations more productive than before. IT professionals are responsible for everything from hardware and networking to social media and data analytics. These technology trends require every organization to take a proactive approach to IT. In this course, IT strategy consultant Peter High outlines how to create an agile IT department, measure IT performance, and create the role of business information officer. He also suggests ways in which leaders can change the organizational conversation about technology by sharing the IT mission, cocreating other departments' strategies, and finding areas of alignment.
