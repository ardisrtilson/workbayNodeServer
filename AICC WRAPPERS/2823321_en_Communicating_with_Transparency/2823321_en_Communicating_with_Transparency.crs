As trust in corporations, governments, and other institutions declines, consumers and employees are demanding more open and honest communication. Lead the charge within your organization: Learn how to communicate with transparency in order to earn back trust and build deeper, lasting connections with the people that matter to your business. Transformation consultant Mory Fontanez makes a compelling case for transparency, drawing from case studies that show its impact in action. Then she explains how to cultivate transparency, communicate your purpose, and express your message with authenticity. Plus, learn how to develop a crisis response plan so your communication doesn’t suffer in a difficult situation—and respond to criticism when your audience doesn’t agree with your take. In the final chapter, see how it all comes together in a transparency action plan, which will help you communicate more consistently and effectively in any scenario.
