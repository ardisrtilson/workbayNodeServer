[Course_Description]
Matthew Hoffman is a Chicago-based artist and designer whose public works have been exhibited internationally. His ideas have been included in publications such as Good and the New York Times Magazine, and his You Are Beautiful movement has evolved from less than 100 stickers in 2002 into a collection of murals, public installations, and exhibitions involving scores of other artists. In this audio-only course, Justin Ahrens visits Matthew in his studio to learn more about the man behind the message. Matthew discusses the genesis of his career, how he grew You Are Beautiful (and grappled with the ensuing success and attention), and how he built the infrastructure needed to turn his passion project into a growing business.
