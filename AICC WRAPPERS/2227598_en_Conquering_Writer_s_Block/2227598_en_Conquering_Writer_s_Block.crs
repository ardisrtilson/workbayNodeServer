[Course_Description]
Are you struggling with writer's block? Staring at a blank page while deadlines go rushing by? Jessica Brody is a professional writer and the author of over 17 books from respected publishers such as Simon & Schuster and Random House. After years of suffering, Jessica developed a series of techniques and mindset shifts that not only reduced but completely eradicated her writer’s block. In this course she shares them with you. Jessica explains what writer's block actually is and introduces lifestyle changes to remove it from your life entirely. Discover the power of meditation and bullet points, when to buckle down and when to take a break, and why you need a new location. The lessons can be applied to any kind of writing—and any writer that wants to be more prolific and inspired.
