[Course_Description]
Learn how to build Access databases to store and retrieve your data more efficiently. Access expert Adam Wilbert explains the concepts behind relational databases, before moving onto building tablesâ€”the foundation of any database. He then demonstrates how to define the relationships between tables and use queries to find and filter data. This course also shows how to apply rules and validation to minimize data entry errors; build an interface for the database from forms, complete with interactive buttons; create reports for printing and sharing; and take steps to maintain the database you created.
