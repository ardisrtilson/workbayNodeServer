How to stand out from the crowd has always been the great challenge in the music business. It was true back when the record industry released 5,000 records a year and it's even more true now that millions of artists are creating and distributing music. Marketing and promotion is what gets your music in front of music consumers. Marketing is about telling your story; promotion is about ongoing efforts that keep your story top of mind. In this class, industry insider Steve Rennie talks about how to market and promote your music and turn music consumers into permanent fans. He'll talk about the key elements of any good marketing plan, whether you are a major label or indie artist. He'll also talk about how to craft your image with your music, photos, and videos and how you can assemble them in a way that gives you the best chance of success. Plus, learn how radio, touring, publicity campaigns, and your web presence play into a music marketing mix.
