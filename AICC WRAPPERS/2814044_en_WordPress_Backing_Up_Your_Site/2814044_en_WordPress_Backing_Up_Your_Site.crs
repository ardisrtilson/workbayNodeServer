[Course_Description]
Backups are critical to getting a WordPress site running again when it's broken or, even worse, hacked. In this course, Morten Rand-Hendriksen covers four different methods for backing up and restoring your WordPress site: manual backups, host-managed backups, third-party plugins, and migration plugins. Morten explores the benefits and drawbacks of each approach, details how they work, and shows how to use each option to restore your site to a stable state. Devote some time to learning how to start backing up your WordPress data now, and save hours of frantic scrambling later.
