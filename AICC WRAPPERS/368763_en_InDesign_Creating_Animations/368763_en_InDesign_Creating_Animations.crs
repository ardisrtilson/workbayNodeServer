[Course_Description]
Get a complete guide to using InDesign's powerful animation features. After laying the groundwork of controlling basic animations via the Animation and Timing panels, author Diane Burns shows how to customize animation settings and motion paths and apply multiple animations to objects. She reviews common animation effects that don't always use obvious techniques, such as how to make a line that draws itself, a neon sign that flashes, or a bicycle that moves. She then dives into more complex projects including animated logos, ads, and books. While the course is output neutral, a chapter is devoted to the various output options, including fixed-layout EPUB and SWF.
