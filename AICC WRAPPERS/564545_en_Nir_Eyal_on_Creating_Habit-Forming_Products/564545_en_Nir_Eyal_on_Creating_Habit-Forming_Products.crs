[Course_Description]
How have apps like Facebook and Snapchat become so popular, so quickly? How do they keep users coming back day after day? The secrets to creating habit-forming products aren't new, but found deep in the roots of human psychology. In his book Hooked, Nir Eyal outlines the fundamentals, distilling years of research and interviews with top product designers. This course translates those lessons for a whole new audience, and is designed to inspire those in product development to try Nir's unique approach. Find out how to manufacture desire using the four steps of the hook model—trigger, action, variable reward, and investment—and apply the strategies of the most persuasive companies to your own business.
