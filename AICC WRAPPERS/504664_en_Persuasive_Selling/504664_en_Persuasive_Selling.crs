[Course_Description]
Understanding how people think and behave is key to the art of persuasionâ€”and any successful sale. In this course, Brian Ahearn draws on the work of social psychologists and behavioral economists to provide concrete, actionable items for each stage of the sales process. To begin, learn the eight psychological concepts that you can employ throughout the sales workflow: reciprocity, liking, social proof, authority, consistency, scarcity, compare/contrast, and because. Next, learn how these concepts play a role in the early stages of the sales cycle, as well as how they can help you realize the qualities of your ideal client, deliver presentations, handle objections, negotiate, close, and ask for referrals. Lastly, learn how to grow from each sale and continuously refine your approach.
