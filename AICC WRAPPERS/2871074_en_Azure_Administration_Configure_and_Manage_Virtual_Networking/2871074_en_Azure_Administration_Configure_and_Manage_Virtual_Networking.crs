[Course_Description]
Learn how to configure and manage virtual networks on Azure. Virtual networks (VNets) connect your virtual machines and other resources, forming the foundation you need to run cloud-based applications. This course provides hands-on coverage of the essential tasks for implementing and managing VNets using either the Azure portal or PowerShell, for quick, command-line control. Instructor Sharon Bennett covers configuring public IP addresses, network interfaces, peering, and Azure DNS. Plus, learn how to create network security groups. This demo-heavy course can also be used as a resource in preparation for the Microsoft Azure Administrator exam (AZ-104).
