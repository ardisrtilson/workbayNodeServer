[Course_Description]
Learn how to play blues piano. In this course, Tricia Woods dives into the basic building blocks of blues, and helps you acquire the skills you need to really sound like a blues player. To begin, Tricia demonstrates the chord progressions for the 12-bar bluesâ€”the most classic of all blues forms. Next, she discusses the blues scale, dominant chords, comping, turnaround, endings, introductions, boogie-woogie bass lines, and more. Note: This course was created and produced by Alfred Music.
