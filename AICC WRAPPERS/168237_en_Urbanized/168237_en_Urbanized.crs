[Course_Description]
Urbanized is a documentary about the design of cities. It looks at the issues and strategies behind urban design and features some of the world's foremost architects, planners, policy makers, builders, and thinkers. It considers the questions: Who shapes our cities, and how do they do it? Unlike many other fields of design, cities aren't created by any one specialist or expert. There are many contributors to urban change, including ordinary citizens who can have a great impact on improving the cities in which they live. By exploring a diverse range of urban design projects around the world, Urbanized frames a global discussion on the future of cities. lynda.com is proud to offer this film to our members, along with over one hour of bonus content.
