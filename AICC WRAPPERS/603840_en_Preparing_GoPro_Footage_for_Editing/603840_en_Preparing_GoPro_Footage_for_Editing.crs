[Course_Description]
After you've captured action shots in the field with your GoPro, you're ready to get your footage off of your camera and into your video editing software. In this course, Rich Harrington walks through how to transfer and organize your GoPro footage so you can edit and share it. He explains how to use built-in tools such as GoPro Studio. He shows how to trim away unwanted clips or parts of clips, transcode footage to formats optimized for video editing, use options—such as the GoPro CineForm codec—to ensure that your files are ready to edit in any popular editing tool, and more. Upon completing this course, you'll have the knowledge you need to prepare footage for major professional and consumer video editing applications.
