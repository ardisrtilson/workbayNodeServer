What is assertiveness? How can you use it effectively while still respecting others’ opinions? In this audio-only course, adapted from the Negotiate Anything podcast, Lousin Mehrabi explains what assertiveness truly is, why it’s important, and how to use conflict to add value to your business and general life. Lousin goes over building the necessary confidence for assertiveness, covers different approaches to advocate for yourself, and concludes with useful advice for dealing with people who don’t like conflict. Lousin Mehrabi is a trainer and advisor in negotiations and emotional intelligence at Lousin Mehrabi: Executive Coaching & Training.
