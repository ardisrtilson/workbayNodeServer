[Course_Description]
What does a product manager actually do? What kind of product manager roles are out there, and how do they differ from project management? In this course, get answers to those questions—and more—as you learn about the different tools and techniques needed to successfully coordinate all aspects of product development. Instructors Cole Mercer and Evan Kimbrell go over the major phases of the product lifecycle and discuss how approaches like agile, scrum, and kanban actually work in real-world situations. Plus, learn how to address real user needs, approach customer development, run MVP experiments, sketch out mobile apps, work with your stakeholders, and much more.
