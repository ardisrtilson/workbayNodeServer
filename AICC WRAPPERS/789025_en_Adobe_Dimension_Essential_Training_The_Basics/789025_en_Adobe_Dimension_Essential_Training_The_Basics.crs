Curious about creating 3D composites? Adobe Dimension is a great place to start. This easy-to-use application can help graphic designers of all skill levels achieve photorealistic 3D effects in advertising projects, photography, abstract art, and much more. In this course, Theresa Jackson goes over the very basics of what Adobe Dimension can do. She begins by helping you get comfortable with the Dimension workspace, providing an overview of the interface and tool panels. She then walks through how to create, edit, and render a product shot, as well as how to leverage some of the cool features Dimension has to offer, such as Substance materials.
