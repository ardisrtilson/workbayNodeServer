Green screen is an easy way to give your videos interest and variety. Subjects are filmed on a green backdrop, which is then replaced in post-production with a new digital background. This course is a filmmakerâ€™s guide to getting started with green screen. Learn the basic concepts and lingo behind green screen, find out how to set up your equipment, and get started keying and editing green-screen footage with popular software, including iMovie, Final Cut, Adobe Premiere, and Adobe After Effects.
