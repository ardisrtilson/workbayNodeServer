[Course_Description]
Electronic dance music has exploded in popularity the last couple years. Knowing how to create dynamic EDM bass lines can make your tracks stand out. In this course, author J. Scott Giaquinta showcases his techniques for EDM basslinesâ€”the same techniques he's used on productions and remixes with such artists as Madonna, Seal, David Bowie, Paul Oakenfold, and Johnny Cash. The course focuses on creating bass lines for four different genres: dubstep, electro house, progressive/trance, and drum and bass. Scott also touches on layering, automation, and sub-basses, and finishing techniques like bussing, tape saturation, and limiters that can give your EDM tracks a distinctive sound. Note: this course features Ableton Live and Native Instruments MASSIVE, but you can follow along with these tutorials in the DAW of your choice. Want to learn more about creating solid EDM tracks?
