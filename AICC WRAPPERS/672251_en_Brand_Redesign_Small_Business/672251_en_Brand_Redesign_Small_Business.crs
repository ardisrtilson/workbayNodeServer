[Course_Description]
Rebranding can help a company rebuild a reputation or go in a new direction. For designers, rebranding projects present a challenge, since the business has a history and a visual identity that the public already recognizes. The solution lies in a systematic approach: auditing the brand to discover what works and what doesn't, fixing the problems, and relaunching the brand with marketing campaigns that position the company for success. Join Von Glitschka, illustrative design guru, for this hands-on project that demonstrates what successful rebranding involves from the designer and the client. He takes the existing brand for a small plumbing and electrical company and asks questions to get a deeper understanding of their goals. He maps the answers to a new name and develops a logo that better represents the brand values. He solicits and incorporates feedback from the client, and then presents the final brand assets. Last, he reviews the uniforms, vehicle wraps, asset library, and advertising campaigns that were developed to complement the new direction.
