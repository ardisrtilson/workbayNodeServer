[Course_Description]
Effective goal setting requires leaders to translate high-level corporate goals down to the business unit, and then break them down even further into team and individual goals. That way, employees can understand how their performance connects to company strategy, financial results, and incentives. In this course, leadership consultant Mike Figliuolo outlines how to set different types of business goals: quantitative, qualitative, commit, and stretch goals. In addition toÂ linking goals to strategy, he emphasizes the importance of setting achievable goals, communicating them clearly, and providing resources so goals can be accomplished. Last, he provides guidance on managing goal performance and adjusting goals as business needs and resources change.
