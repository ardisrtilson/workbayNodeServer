While inevitable, difficult conversations can be one of the most challenging parts of a manager’s job. Avoiding these conversations can be costly for organizations, resulting in absenteeism, poor performance, turnover, and even litigation. In this course, instructor Marlene Chism walks you through how to minimize emotional upset and conduct challenging conversations to achieve the best outcome for all parties. Marlene outlines four signs that it’s time to have a conversation, and what to do if you’ve waited too long. Learn about how to set the right tone for a productive interaction that can result in an improved relationship, and discover a conversation blueprint that can help make conversations easier and help you stay in control.
