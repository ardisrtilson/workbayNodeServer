[Course_Description]
Security affects everyone who uses the internet and shares personal data. Consequently, it's not a concern that should be confined to your organization's information security department. Here, join Mandy Huth—the director of information security at Smarsh—as she shares tips that can empower you to keep your own data safe, as well as convey the significance of information security to others in your company. Learn how to talk about security with non-security people, build a security-minded culture, sell security to customers, collaborate with IT, protect yourself and your family from security threats, and more.
