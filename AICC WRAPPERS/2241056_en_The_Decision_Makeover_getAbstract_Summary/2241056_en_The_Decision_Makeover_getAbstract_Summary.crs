Decisions determine the quality, scope, and tenor of your life. People who make good decisions usually live more successful, satisfying lives. Like all mental disciplines, smart decision-making requires following certain guidelines and principles, as Mike Whitaker spells out in his instructive book, The Decision Makeover. This audio-only summary by getAbstract conveys Whitaker’s lessons on making better decisions in every aspect of your life. This primer is ideal for those who want a more systematic approach to decision-making, including students, young adults, people in mid-career, individuals in crisis, and those who must deal with challenging, multifaceted problems. This audiobook summary was created by getAbstract, the world’s largest provider of business book summaries. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
