[Course_Description]
Using real-life case studies, negotiation expert Deborah Kolb and seasoned executive leader Elizabeth Robillard offer practical advice and techniques to help leaders manage workplace negotiations. Recognizing that all negotiation takes place within a context, Debbie and Elizabeth explain the organizational dynamics of work and reveal how we often get in our own way by not speaking up and asking for what we want. They show you how to position yourself to negotiate, how to get the other person to the table, how to advocate for yourself while still working collaboratively to achieve an agreement.
