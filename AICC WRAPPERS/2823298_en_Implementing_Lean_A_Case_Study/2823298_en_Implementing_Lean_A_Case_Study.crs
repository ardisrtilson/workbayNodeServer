[Course_Description]
Seating Matters is an excellent example of a company practicing lean thinking principles. The company wondered how other organizations worked so well to produce world-class products, while it struggled with excess inventory, slow production, and dependency on vendors. There had to be a solution. In this course, the founders share the Seating Matters journey: how this family-owned business was started, how it has grown through the years, and why it turned to lean principles to truly thrive. Hear about the companyâ€™s journey introducing and implementing lean, and how members hold each other accountable to the highest lean standards as they continue on their never-ending journey of continuous improvement. This course was created by Gemba Academy, a leading provider of lean and Six Sigma training. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
