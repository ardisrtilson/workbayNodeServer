It explains its impact on society and recommends specific tactics for leaders and managers who want to foster a democratic workplace. This insightful, audio-only summary from getAbstract provides you with the key take-aways of Sustein’s extensive research on the subject of polarization and will be of interest to anyone who values open debate.
