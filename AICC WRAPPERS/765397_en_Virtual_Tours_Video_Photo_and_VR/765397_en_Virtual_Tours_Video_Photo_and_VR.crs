[Course_Description]
In recent years, 360° and VR photos and videos have emerged as fresh, exciting platforms for viewing content. Whether it's showing off the inside of a business or simply sharing an experience, virtual tours are one of the most immersive ways to see a space from the comfort of your own home or mobile device. In this case, learn how to showcase a space or experience by creating your very own virtual tour. Instructor Richard Harrington shows how to create floor plans, shoot both 360° video and photos, and piece together all of your 360° assets to build a tour.
