[Course_Description]
Adobe Illustrator is a key tool for creating web content and assets. Using the strong layout and color management tools in Illustrator along with ability to use vector-based assets, designers can create vibrant web assets. In this course, Emily Kay breaks down the key features and workflows that web designers need to know to get up and running quickly. Emily covers topics such as designing responsively, using the library for asset management, and how using graphic and typographic styles and symbols allow you to streamline and control elements globally. She also goes over the development process—including how to create site maps, wireframes, moodboards, and comps—and explains how to create and export optimized web graphics and SVG files for scalable, resolution-independent graphics in the browser.
