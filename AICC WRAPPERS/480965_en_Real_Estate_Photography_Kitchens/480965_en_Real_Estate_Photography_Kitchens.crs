[Course_Description]
For real estate and architectural photographers, a kitchen can be the most challenging room to photograph. Shiny, reflective surfaces and tight confines are common conditions, increasing the complexity of shooting the room. In this course, photographer Scott Hargis demonstrates techniques you can apply to capture a kitchen at its best. He shows you how to set up, take test shots, assess the situation, and adjust your lighting and composition accordingly. He also covers how to style the kitchen and how to edit the photos.
