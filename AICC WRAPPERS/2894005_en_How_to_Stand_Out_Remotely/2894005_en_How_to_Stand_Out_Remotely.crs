[Course_Description]
As remote work has become the norm in today’s workplaces, many workers now enjoy previously unheard-of levels of freedom and flexibility. However, these new benefits also come with new concerns and problems. Not only is it more difficult to connect with colleagues casually—much less create memorable interactions and experiences— it can be easy to feel like you're lost in the shuffle. In this course, Bianca Lager shows you how to stand out as a remote employee (for good reasons). Bianca starts with the basic logistics and tools you need for success, from organizing your workspace into a camera-ready environment, to making sure all your hardware and software functions as it should. She also shows how to create a plan, set proper boundaries, improve communications, deal with conflict, and improve your relationship with your manager. Finally, Bianca shares specific remote working tips for leaders and managers. This course was created by Madecraft. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
