[Course_Description]
Explore workplace visualization: a critical aspect of lean management. Learn how to bring the concept of visuality to the workplace and see how real-world companies are successfully leveraging these principles in their offices and shop floors. This course defines workplace visualization, aka visual management, and its benefits. Discover specific steps you and your organization can take as you work to implement visual management into your workplace. Then learn the six key questions to consider when implementing visual management: the 5W1H, which stands for who, what, where, when, why, and how. The journey concludes with a discussion on how to start your own visual management initiative, including how to properly scope your efforts. This course was created by Gemba Academy, a leading provider of lean and Six Sigma training. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
