[Course_Description]
Transition your Photoshop-based web design process to a more UX-based workflow by adding Adobe XD. Vector-based XD allows for faster design revisions, easy adaptability to a variety of device sizes, and quicker development of prototypes to get customer buy-in before the development process begins. In this course, youâ€™ll learn how to set up XD, prototype and collaborate your UX designs with clients and stakeholders, leverage cross-product workflows between Photoshop and XD, and export web-ready assets for developers.
