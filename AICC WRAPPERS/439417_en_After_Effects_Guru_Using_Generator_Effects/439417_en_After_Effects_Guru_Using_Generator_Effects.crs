Generator effects can be used to solve many problems when creating motion graphics and VFX projectsâ€”and to add unique creative twists you can't replicate with other After Effects tools. In this course, author Ian Robinson shows how to use generator effects to attach multiple layers, create animated glints and highlights, achieve better blended composites, and more. Follow along as he introduces a variety of next-level mograph techniques for creating interesting backgrounds, repeating graphic elements, and applying 2D and 3D type treatments, and walks through a complete map-based infographic generated with effects like Grid, Stroke, Vegas, Write-on, and Radio Waves.
