[Course_Description]
Do you need to work with an older design that predates CAD, or design an accessory for a third-party product? If so, then this course is for you. Join instructor Steven Marjieh as he acquaints you with the fundamentals of reverse engineering, which allows you to infer a model from an object and work with it in your own designs. Learn how to use physical measurement, 3D scanning, and touch probes to measure real-world objects and work with them in your CAD tool of choice. Plus, learn how to best approach the post-processing of scan data, including how to inspect the final parts and verify that they're correct.
