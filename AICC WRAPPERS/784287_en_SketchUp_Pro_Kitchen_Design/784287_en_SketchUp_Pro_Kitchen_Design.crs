[Course_Description]
Have you been thinking about renovating your kitchen? Design the kitchen of your dreams with SketchUp. This course teaches you how to design a new kitchen that fits your existing space using this easy-to-use 3D drawing program. Scott Onstott shows how to model and digitally demolish your current kitchen to make room for the new design, and start adding new cabinets, counters, appliances, fixtures, and lighting, as well as modern, must-have features such as a standalone island. Plus, learn how to create an animated walkthrough with first-person navigation and animation. Along the way, you can learn how to work with SketchUp layers, groups, components, styles, scenes, and ready-made models from the 3D Warehouse.
