[Course_Description]
The creative process isn't just generating ideas. The reality is it's a five-step process, and ideation is only one of those steps. The entire creative process is made up of objective finding, data gathering, problem design, ideation, and selection. Understanding the role of each step enables us to ensure that we generate the most effective solutions. In this course, Stefan Mumaw guides you through the five steps and then shows what the complete process looks like, with a real-world project: designing a website.
