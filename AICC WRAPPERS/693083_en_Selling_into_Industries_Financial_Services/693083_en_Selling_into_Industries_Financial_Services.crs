The financial industry can be a particularly challenging vertical to sell into. Factors such as rigorous reporting deadlines and shifting regulations provide obstacles that aren't easily navigated. In this course, Lisa Earle McLeod and Elizabeth McLeod equip you with practical tips and strategies for selling to financial buyers. Discover how to unpack an annual report and leverage that information in your sales process, as well as how to identify the key metrics that drive your buyer's decision making. In addition, learn how to prove your ROI and develop authentic relationships in an inherently untrusting industry.
