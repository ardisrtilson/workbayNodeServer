[Course_Description]
The antithesis of the static logo is the flexible visual identity: an adaptable design system that can communicate a brand at any size, in any formatâ€”maximizing your creative options and your design's continuity. In this course, designer Von Glitschka teaches you how to create a flexible identity system from scratch. He starts with the logo, secondary graphics, and style guide that will provide the basis for your identity system, before diving into specifics such as business cards, letterhead, signage, vehicle wraps, ads, promotional items, and more. Von uses Adobe Illustrator for design and layout, but you can follow along with the software of your choice.
