[Course_Description]
Travel is expensive, so you need to be sure your time on the road justifies the investment. In this course, Tom Geller outlines what you need to do before, during, and after your business trip to keep yourself comfortable, meet your client's or employer's objectives, and take care of your home while you're away. Learn the tools you need to stay in touch with the office, and find out how to pack a go bag that prepares you for business. Tom also provides guidance on managing transportation and staying safe in your new city, and outlines tips for reporting back what you've learned when you return home, so each trip is easier and more productive than the last.
