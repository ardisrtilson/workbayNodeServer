[Course_Description]
With PowerPoint Online, you can create, edit, and share presentations directly in your web browser. The web app is flexible and powerful, but it differs from the desktop version of PowerPoint. In this course, Microsoft Certified Trainer Heather Severino walks you through all the unique features of PowerPoint Online. She begins with basics, showing how to create, open, and save files in a browser. Next, she walks through slide layout essentials, such as adding headers and footers, and shows how to incorporate visuals such as charts, photos, videos, and audio. She also demonstrates how to share and co-edit presentations, as well as view and print PowerPoint files. Finally, she shares some handy keyboard shortcuts and explains how to get help with the Tell Me feature. Note: This course is for users who know the basics of the PowerPoint desktop app, but are new to the web browser version, PowerPoint Online. It emphasizes features that work differently in PowerPoint Online. For basic PowerPoint guidance, please see PowerPoint Essential Training (Office 365) or Learning PowerPoint 2019.
