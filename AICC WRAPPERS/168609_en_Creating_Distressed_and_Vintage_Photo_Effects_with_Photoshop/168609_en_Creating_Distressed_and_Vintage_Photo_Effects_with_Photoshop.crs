[Course_Description]
Sometimes a photo conveys a more powerful message if it's less than perfect. In this course, photographer and educator Seán Duggan shows how to use Photoshop to create vintage and distressed photo effects. After reviewing the kinds of things that make a photo look old—fading, chemical deterioration, physical damage, and so on—Sean shows how to re-create those effects in Photoshop. He also explores other facets of vintage photography, from lens distortion to light leaks, and shows how to simulate them. The course concludes with details on adding texture and border effects to your finished photos.
