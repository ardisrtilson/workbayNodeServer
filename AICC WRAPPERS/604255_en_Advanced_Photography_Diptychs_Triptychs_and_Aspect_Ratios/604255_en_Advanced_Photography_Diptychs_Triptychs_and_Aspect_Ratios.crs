[Course_Description]
What effect do different photo orientations and aspect ratios have on an image? How can you use multiple images, grouped into a diptych or triptych, to convey a more powerful message? In this course, photographer and educator Justin Reznick explores your options, covering both the aesthetic issues and Photoshop techniques used to make more interesting compositions. Learn how to combine images, split one image into multiple parts, prepare your work—including prints—for sale, and use the Shoot & Sell app to market your photography to clients.
