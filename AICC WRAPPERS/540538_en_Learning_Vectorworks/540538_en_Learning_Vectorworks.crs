Built upon a long history of powerful CAD and BIM development, Vectorworks offers a feature set that helps users design and create projects using an eﬃcient workflow. In this course, get familiar with the core features of this powerful software. Henry Santos walks through the user interface and shows how the workspace is organized. In addition, by taking you through a small project—a table design—he provides a hands-on approach to learning this software package. He also covers the drafting and design tools, explores basic 3D modeling, shows how to use the resource manager, and more.
