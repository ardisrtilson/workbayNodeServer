[Course_Description]
Lighting has changed in the last few years. With so many choices, how can you know what type of lights are right for your video production? Erik Naso helps you evaluate your specific needs so you can keep costs low and make informed equipment selections. Explore traditional and emerging lighting options. See how different lights perform in specific settings, like on-location or in studio, and for different purposes, like lighting talent during interviews or illuminating large rooms. Familiarize yourself with the ins and outs of electronically controlled lights—some LED lights have advance, computer-like circuitry—so you can vary color and output.
