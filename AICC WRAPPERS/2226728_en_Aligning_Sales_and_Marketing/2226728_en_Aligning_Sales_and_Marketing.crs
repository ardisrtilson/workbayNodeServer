[Course_Description]
Sales and marketing don’t always play for the same side. Each group undervalues the contributions of the other—and this conflict hurts the entire company. However, when sales and marketing align there’s a major impact on company performance across the board. Sales cycles are shorter, the cost of acquisitions goes down, and you finally start seeing the revenue growth in your margins. This course helps organizations align sales and marketing to optimize business and achieve serious growth. Sales expert Marcus Murphy helps you understand where communication breaks down and shows ways to build it back up, increasing partnership and investment in the same shared goals. By the end of the course, you’ll have all the tools you need to end the standoff—and get everyone on the same team.
