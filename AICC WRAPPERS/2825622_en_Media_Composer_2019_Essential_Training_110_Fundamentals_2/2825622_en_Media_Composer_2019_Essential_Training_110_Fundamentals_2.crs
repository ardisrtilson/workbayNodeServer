[Course_Description]
Learn to import, edit, refine, and output video using Avid Media Composer. This course is the second part of a two-part, start-to-finish, project-based training series designed to get you up to speed on the Media Composer environment in context of the Avid Everywhere model. Maxim Jago —an Avid Certified Instructor with 20 years of experience—focuses on getting users comfortable with each aspect of the editing process—from preparation and organization, to editing and trimming video, to audio mixing and effects, to media management and output. You can also learn creative techniques for retiming footage, tracking and blurring objects, creating precise mattes, and more. Each technique within the post-production workflow is explained thoroughly and concisely, using real-world examples from a documentary-style promotional project. This course is an official companion to Media Composer 101: Media Composer Fundamentals I, the introductory book from Avid. In each chapter, Maxim expands on the lessons and exercises found in the book. Together, these resources can help novice users quickly start leveraging this powerful software. This course was created by Maxim Jago. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
