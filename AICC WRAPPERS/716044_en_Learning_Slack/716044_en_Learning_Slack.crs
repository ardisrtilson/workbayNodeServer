Learn to collaborate seamlessly with Slack, the popular team messaging tool. Slack allows you to have conversations wherever you are: in a web browser, on a Mac or PC, or on the mobile app. In this course, Gini von Courter gets you up and running quickly, showing how to log in, join channels, and start writing messages right away in Slack. She also explains how to upload, share, and comment on links and files; how to create and manage channels; and how to integrate with 1,500+ supported apps, including Twitter and Google Calendar. Plus, learn how to set up a new Slack workspace and configure your team roles and permissions to fit your organization's communication style.
