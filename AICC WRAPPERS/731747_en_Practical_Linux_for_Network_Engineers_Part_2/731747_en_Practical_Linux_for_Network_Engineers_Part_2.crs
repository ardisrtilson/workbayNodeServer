[Course_Description]
Linux is a critical skill for network engineers. Many network operating systems use Linux, as do software-defined networking and DevOps tools such as OpenDaylight and Git. Don't get left behind. Practical Linux series teaches Linux from the network engineer's perspective, providing practical, hands-on lessons on Linux fundamentals. This course, part two, shows how to set up vital Linux services for file transfer and networking, and how to configure a software-defined network (SDN) to centralize and automate network provisioning and maintenance. Learn how to configure and run TFTP, DNS, and DHCP servers; use Linux switches; and set up an SDN with Docker containers, OpenFlow vSwitch virtual switches, OpenDaylight, and the OpenFlow network communication protocol. Note: This course uses GNS3 for all demonstrations.
