As well as satisfying legal requirements, annual reports serve an important marketing and communication function and allow companies to tell their story. An annual report is a prestigious assignment for any designer and can make a satisfying piece for your portfolio. In this course, you can learn how to think strategically about the kind of information an annual report needs to include and create a design that clearly communicates the businessâ€™s activities and performance. Instructor Nigel French also explains how to build the design elements that are commonly employed in annual reports, including infographics, pull quotes, callouts, and a consistent style of imagery.
