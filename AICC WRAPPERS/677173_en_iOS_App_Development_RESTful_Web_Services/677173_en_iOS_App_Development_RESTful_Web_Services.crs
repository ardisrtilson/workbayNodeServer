Review the key concepts you need to know to create queries to a RESTful JSON server API. Learn the core fundamentals for creating a request, and review how to do the standard operations on server-side data: create, read, update, and delete (CRUD).

Plus, learn about more advanced uses of the Codable protocol, including how to implement manual decoding of data.
