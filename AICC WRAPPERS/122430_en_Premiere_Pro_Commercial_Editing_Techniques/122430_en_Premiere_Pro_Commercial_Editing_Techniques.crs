[Course_Description]
Learn to creatively compose short-form advertisements using Adobe Premiere Pro. Author Christine Steele explores how to communicate and market an idea that does more than just sell a product or service, by experimenting with concepts that help the audience feel, rather than think. The techniques in this course break from the more narrative style of film and television storytelling, and allow you to explore alternative visual messaging styles. First Christine shows you how to use style frames and temporary audio to nail down an idea before you start editing. Then you'll learn how to construct the rough cut: in this case, an action montage interspersed with hero shots that define and highlight the brand messaging. You'll refine your cut with motion graphics, final audio, and effects, and learn to manipulate color, lighting, and timing to increase your audience's emotional reaction to the spot. Last, learn the basics of layering sound effects, audio filters, and subtle volume adjustments to create an effective sound mix for your commercial.
