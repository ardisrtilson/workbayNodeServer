From a group picture on a hiking trail to a professional headshot, your photos encapsulate important parts of your life—and perhaps your career, as well. Keep your shots safe and sound by cultivating a solid backup workflow. In this course, Tim Grey goes over issues to consider when planning your workflow—such as the time required for a backup job and which risks to worry about—and goes into different backup options, from cloud-based storage to hard drive and RAID systems. Learn best practices for protecting your photos and create a long-term backup solution that you can feel confident about.
