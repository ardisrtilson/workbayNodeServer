[Course_Description]
Learn to create dynamic Hollywood-style title sequences for movie trailers, using the tools in CINEMA 4D. EJ Hassenfratz shows how to create attention-grabbing text elements, apply textures and lighting, and animate the titles in styles that suit two different genres: action flicks and fantasy films. Then you'll learn how to render the scene and bring the assets into After Effects, in order to composite them with live-action footage and preview the final trailers. These tutorials follow a real-world workflow, used in many of the leading Hollywood production studios.
