To grow your career in construction or manufacturing, you need more than just training in one of the skilled trades. You need a way of distinguishing yourself from all the other candidates in your field. In this course, Bridget Quinn—an electrical industry veteran with 20 years of experience—goes over the different components of a skilled trades portfolio, as well as how to create one that effectively highlights all that you have to offer. Bridget steps through how to craft a stellar cover letter and resume. She also highlights other items you might want to add to your portfolio, such as certifications and letters of recommendation, and how to best present them. To wrap up, she shares practical ways you can build your experience and qualifications to enhance your resume even further.
