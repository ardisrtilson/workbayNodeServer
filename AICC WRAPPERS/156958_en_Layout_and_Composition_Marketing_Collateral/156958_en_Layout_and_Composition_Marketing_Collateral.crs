[Course_Description]
Marketing collateral gives your audience a chance to hold something in their hand, get important news right from their mailbox, and encounter your product or idea on a poster in a public place. Sean Adams, cofounder of renowned design firm AdamsMorioka, helps you make the most of these opportunities by designing great marketing materials. He begins by talking about the importance of preparation: the essential fact finding that needs to happen before any design can begin. He then dives into the key elements of marketing materials (copy, images, paper, and printing method). The remaining chapters break down the design process for the most common marketing pieces (brochures, business cards, posters, media kits, and promotional pieces like holiday cards and swag). These lessons will help you make design decisions that will intrigue your audience and save your campaign money along the way.
