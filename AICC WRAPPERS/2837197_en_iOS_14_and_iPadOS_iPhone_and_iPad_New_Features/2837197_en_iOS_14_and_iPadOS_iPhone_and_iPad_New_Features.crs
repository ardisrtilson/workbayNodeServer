Curious about what iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 have to offer? This course can help you get up to speed. Instructor Garrick Chow delves into the useful new features packed into iOS 14, including compact interfaces that make incoming calls and Siri take up less of your screen, built-in voice dictation, and widget stacks, which help you maximize the real estate on your home screen. Garrick also dives into changes to built-in apps. Learn about improvements to Messages that help keep your conversations organized and easy to access, a brand-new app called Translate, and more. Plus, Garrick shares what's new in iPadOS 14, covering features such as Scribble, which converts the text you write by hand with the Apple Pencil into typed text.
