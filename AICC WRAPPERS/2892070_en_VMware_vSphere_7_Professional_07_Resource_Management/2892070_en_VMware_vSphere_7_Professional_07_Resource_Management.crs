[Course_Description]
VMware vSphere is everywhere. In order to stay relevant, you must understand vSphere. Perhaps youâ€™re also preparing to take the VMware Certified Professional Datacenter Virtualization (VCP-DCV) exam. In this series of courses, Rick Crisci, a VMware Certified Instructor, walks you through over 50 real life demos in a vSphere 7 environment using the HTML5 vSphere Client. This course focuses specifically on resource management. Rick introduces you to configuring reservations and limits in vSphere and setting up shared resources. He demonstrates how you can use hotplug settings to alter the number of CPUs and memory that a VM has without turning it off. He steps you through resource pools, scalable shares, and expandable reservations, then concludes with a demo of how to create and configure vApps for multitier applications. Note: This course was created by Rick Crisci. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
