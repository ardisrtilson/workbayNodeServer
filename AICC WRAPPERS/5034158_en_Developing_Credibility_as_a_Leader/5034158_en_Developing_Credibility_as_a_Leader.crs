The work of leadership is to inspire action toward a shared vision. As a leader, if you cannot be seen as a trusted and credible person, then your message will go nowhere.

Dorie Clark answers these questions and more in this practical course. Get tips for demonstrating credibility within a larger team, becoming a more collaborative leader, and burnishing your credibility regardless of your title. Plus, learn how to bounce back if your credibility has been damaged or you need to break a promise.
