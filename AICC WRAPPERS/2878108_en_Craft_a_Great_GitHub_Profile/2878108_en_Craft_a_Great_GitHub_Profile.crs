You might have heard that GitHub is a great way to find a developer job. The question is, how? For as many great contributions you’ve made, it’s all for naught if they go unnoticed.

She covers basics from working with your profile image and contributing code, to modifying the default GitHub template and personalizing your custom profile.

For a career in software development, your GitHub profile tells potential employers a great deal about who you are, what you do, and where your interests lie.
