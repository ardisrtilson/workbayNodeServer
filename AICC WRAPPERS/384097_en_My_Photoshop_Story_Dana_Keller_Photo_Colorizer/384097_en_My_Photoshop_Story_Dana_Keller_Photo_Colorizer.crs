[Course_Description]
On the eve of Photoshop's 25th anniversary, we asked early adopters and pioneering artists to tell us their Photoshop stories. Dana Keller bridges the worlds of art and archival science by colorizing black-and-white photographsâ€”relying on research and Photoshop. In this short film, Dana explains how he uses color to connect viewers to the past and how Photoshop, when used correctly, highlights the history of the image, not the process behind it.
