[Course_Description]
Having a solid understanding of how compositing works—and what can be achieved in After Effects—can alter your overall approach to shooting time lapses. In this course, Keith Kiska demonstrates how to effectively apply 3D motion and compositing effects in After Effects to create superior time-lapse shots. Keith explains how to add dynamic movement to static shots, and goes over how to add or remove elements from your shots. He also shares helpful methods for compositing layered shots by adding skies, composing stylized text into your time-lapse shots, and creating HyperZoom time lapses.
