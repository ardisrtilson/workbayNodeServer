This course was designed to help you spot these individuals and keep their mind games from getting under your skin. Instructor Chris Croft delves into the theory of why people play games, how these games work, and how to recognize when someone is playing one with you. He then covers the 20 most common games people play, demystifying manipulative techniques like only joking and only trying to help. To wrap up, he shares six practical techniques for disarming games players and regaining your control over difficult situations. Tune in to equip yourself with tools and techniques for dealing with this challenging personality type.
