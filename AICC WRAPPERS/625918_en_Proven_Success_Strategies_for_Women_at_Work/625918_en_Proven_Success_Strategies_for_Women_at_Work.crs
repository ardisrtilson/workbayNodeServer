[Course_Description]
Women are underrepresented in the C-suite. And women who aspire to leadership roles face unique challenges in today's companies. They are passed over for key opportunities, paid less than their male colleagues, and left out of critical networks and sponsor relationships. Additionally, smaller everyday challenges impede women's progress at work, like being interrupted in meetings, having their ideas stolen, or having to do 'invisible work' for no credit. Being a woman at work today requires a unique set of skills and strategies. In this course, business consultants Deborah Kolb and Elizabeth Robillard help women learn these strategies so they can get the job they want, the pay they deserve, and the credit that counts. They provide guidance on how to identify challenges, negotiate for better opportunities and compensation, get helpful feedback, and create a network of support. In the course, they use scenarios of real women tacking these challenges and coming out ahead.
