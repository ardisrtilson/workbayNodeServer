[Course_Description]
Professionals spend a third of their day at a desk. Desks act as a familiar home base and are comfortable work destinations, but they can also drain our creative energy. Turn your desk back into a creative idea station where inspiration is always just an arm's reach away. In this course, Stefan Mumaw offers 21 days of desk-based creative exercises that show you have everything you need to be your creative bestâ€”right in front of you. Follow along with each 10-minute challenge using only the materials you can reach at your desk. Every day, you can show the world how creative you really are by taking a pic of your creation and sharing it on Instagram using a unique hashtag tailored to each challenge.
