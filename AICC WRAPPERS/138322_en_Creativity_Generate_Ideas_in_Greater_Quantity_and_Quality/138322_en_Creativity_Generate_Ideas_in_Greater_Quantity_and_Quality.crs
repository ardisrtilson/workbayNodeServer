Creativity is not an external force or a rare skill; it's a habit that can be learned and exercised every day. This course challenges preconceived notions about creativity and provides valuable tools that will unlock this skill to help you generate better ideas faster. Let Stefan Mumaw help you identify and break down creative obstacles, and lead you through a few short, fun exercises that build your creative muscles, while illuminating key points about your behavior, experience, and perspective that you might not have realized before.
