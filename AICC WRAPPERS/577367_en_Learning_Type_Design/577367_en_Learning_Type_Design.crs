If you want to become a good type designer, diving into the study of type is beneficial. It's important to know what makes a good face, how details are used to define a family, and how to edit your designs so that they look well balanced and consistent, not off-kilter. In this course, join Charles Nix as he sets you on the right path with best practices and details on how to achieve a cohesive collection of letters. He helps you understand exactly what makes a typeface great, explores tools, methods, and materials, shows how to draw the basic glyphs, and explains how to produce a functioning font.
