[Course_Description]
Shooting a scene outside—particularly on a sunny day—can present some unique challenges. It can be difficult to get the best angle when working out in the sun, and even if you do, the light can be harsh and unflattering. In this course, discover how to use the sun to light your talent in a way that makes them look their best. Erik Naso discusses diffusion, including how to build frames for various fabric-based lighting options. He also shares how to bounce the sunlight with fabric reflectors and bounce boards, use a black net to expose backgrounds, shoot with a landmark in frame, light and shoot in shade, and more.
