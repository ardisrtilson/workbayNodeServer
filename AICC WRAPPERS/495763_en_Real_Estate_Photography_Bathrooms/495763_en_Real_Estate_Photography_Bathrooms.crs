[Course_Description]
On a real estate shoot, even if the photographer is pressed for time, the master bathroom nearly always ends up on the shot list. It's a space that every buyer wants to preview. In this course, Scott Hargis provides specifics on capturing this all-important room by demonstrating the lighting, composition, and styling techniques that make a master bathroom look its best. Follow Scott as he takes you to a shoot at a typical home in the hills above Oakland, California. He shows you three different approaches for capturing that same space: a method for taking an acceptable photo when you're in a time crunch, a method for snapping a portfolio-worthy photo, and a method for taking a shot that can make an ordinary space look like it was plucked from a brochure. Scott also explains how to edit your final image selections.
