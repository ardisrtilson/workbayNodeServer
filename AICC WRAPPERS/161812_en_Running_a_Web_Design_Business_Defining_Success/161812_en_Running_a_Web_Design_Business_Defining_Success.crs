[Course_Description]
Although there's nothing wrong with making money (it's the necessary lifeblood of every business), it's not what gets most entrepreneurs up every morning. So what drives you? In this course, Lauren Bacon explores the stuff that really gets your creative juices flowingâ€”and shows how to fold those into a more focused, purpose-driven business plan. You might discover that, for you, success looks like location independence and collaborating with creative professionals who inspire you. Or perhaps you need to continually challenge yourself and broaden your skillset. You might thrive on variety or stability, fast growth or slow, happy clients or plenty of quiet time to perfect your craft. Lauren introduces techniques that will help you hone in on your personal definition of success, two exercises to identify core values, and a formula for establishing concrete income goals for your design business. Get clear on these success factors, and your business plan will flow. Skip this step, and you could find yourself wondering why your business just doesn't feel as satisfying as you'd hoped.
