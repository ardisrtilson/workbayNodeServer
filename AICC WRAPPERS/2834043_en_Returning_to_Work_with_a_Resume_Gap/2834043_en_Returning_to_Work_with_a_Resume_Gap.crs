[Course_Description]
If you’re looking to return to work after taking a career break, even a brief one, the process can feel daunting, confusing, and discouraging, especially if you’re navigating the process on your own. In this course, Kelley Biskupiak and Susan Rietano Davey—founders of Prepare to Launch U, a firm focused on work-life transitions—guide you through the steps on the path to reentering the workforce. They cover topics like leveraging your skills and experience, writing your resume and LinkedIn profile, and understanding your motivations for returning to work in order to set you on the right path. Having successfully navigated their own returns to work after career breaks, Kelley and Susan deliver firsthand knowledge that will help you brush up your skills, rebrand yourself post-break, and set yourself up for a successful career return.
