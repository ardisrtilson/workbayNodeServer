[Course_Description]
The SQL programming language opens the door to deeper and more efficient software testing. SQL allows testers to examine the back end of application, automate testing through scripting, and simplify and speed up data generation. This course provides a quick-start guide to database testing with SQL. Dave Westerveld shows how to choose the right tools, set up a local site, and start validating data using simple SQL table joins. Next, you can learn how to generate test data by creating, updating, and deleting table entries. Finally, learn how to test SQL queries and find bugs in transactions, implement field constraints to prevent future bugs, and use schema validation to improve the quality of your application. Plus, find out how to prevent unauthorized access to data and measure the runtime of your queries to make sure you're not impeding database performance.
