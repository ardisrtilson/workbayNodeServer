Can great design solve the problems of the developing world? Krista Donaldson, CEO of D-Rev, believes that by combining emerging technology with designs that meet real demands, we can improve the health and prosperity of people living on less than $4 a day. In this Creative Spark, Krista talks about the evolution of her company's most successful productsâ€”from LED phototherapy devices that cure jaundice in newborns to affordable, cutting-edge prosthetics. She explains how D-Rev identifies real-world needs, prototypes designs, refines them with user feedback, and solves problems from distribution to ongoing service repair.
