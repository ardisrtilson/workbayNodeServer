[Course_Description]
The Science of Compassion audio-only series takes a deep dive into the many forms and different aspects of compassion, and in this course, Kelly McGonigal begins to look at some of the more difficult types of compassion. As she explains, some forms of compassion require courage, to go beyond your compassion comfort zone and stretch your capacity to care, forgive, and embrace. Kelly examines the fears that people encounter when they start to broaden their compassion beyond what feels natural or easy, and highlights some of the most common fears of compassion and how to work through them. Also included is a guided practice you can use to help you embrace the lessons in this course, and recognize the interconnection of courage, fear, and compassion.
