Ready to speed up Ruby on Rails development? Understanding how ActiveRecord is used to create, update, and retrieve data in a relational database is fundamental to writing more efficient, object-oriented code. This course helps you understand the basics of ActiveRecord and leverage shortcuts and techniques to make data migrations faster and more powerful. Kevin Skoglund reviews the basics of working with database records, and shows how to use ActiveRecord queries to locate records faster. He also shows how to use callbacks to automate functionality when objects are saved or deleted, and create associations between ActiveRecord models to streamline common operations. By the end of the course, you will have the skills you need to write concise, high-performance Rails code that eliminates the need to deal with SQL and other tedious database queries.
