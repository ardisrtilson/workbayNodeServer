Success happens when you have the right mindset, skillset, and can reset. In this course, Scott Mautz helps you develop a mindset for success by showing you how to improve your self-confidence and mentally prepare yourself to thrive under pressure. As Scott explains, success comes from habits, and habits are more easily formed from simple, repeatable exercises. In each part of this course, Scott gives you short mindset, skillset, and reset habits to choose from to create your own tailored routine for success. After this course, youâ€™ll have a wider skillset for success to help you to refocus, refresh, and avoid the procrastination that often comes with increased responsibilities and stress.
