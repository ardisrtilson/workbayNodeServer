[Course_Description]
Customer acquisition is one of the most expensive investments a company can make. When you win a customer, you want to keep them for life. Increasing customer loyalty—those positive feelings that customers have about your brand—is the best way to increase sales, retention, and the overall value of your company. In this course, bestselling author Noah Fleming reveals the four stages of the customer loyalty loop: an ongoing cycle of engaging, converting, serving, and rewarding the customers that engage with your business. He shows how to apply these lessons by developing a customer loyalty action plan and customer loyalty program tailored for the needs of your business. Using these techniques, you can identify and retain your most valuable customers and keep them loyal for life.
