[Course_Description]
Tech is one of those rare places where demand for jobs is higher than the supply. With that in mind, how can recruiters and hiring managers get the best candidates for the job into the jobs theyâ€™re trying to fill? One way is by understanding the tech well enough to know exactly what you need. In this series of courses, instructor Ayub Shaikh goes over high-level IT concepts and breaks them into related, easy-to-remember groupings. This course focuses specifically on recruiting software developers. Ayub explains what makes up application software and what developers, engineers, and other titles actually do. He also covers differences between recruiting front-end developers and recruiting back-end developers. Note: This course was created by Holistica Consulting. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
