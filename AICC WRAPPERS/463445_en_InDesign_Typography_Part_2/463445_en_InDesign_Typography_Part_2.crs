InDesign Typography explores the numerous type options, type-related features, and type-specific preferences of Adobe InDesign. Using practical, real-world examples, instructor and designer Nigel French explains the purpose of each feature and describes the conventions for how and when to use it. Part 2 focuses on macro typography or how type is arranged on a page. Nigel discusses text flow, type alignment, indents and spacing, text wrap, and lists. He also shows how to use InDesign styles, which will save time formatting text and keep your designs more consistent, robust, and easier to edit. The final chapter address hyphenation, line breaks, and other type controls; the selective use of white space; the value of grids in graphic design; and approaches for combining multiple typefaces in a single layout.
