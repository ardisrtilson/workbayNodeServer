Giving a talk can be a career-defining moment. Somebody in the audience might offer you a job or submit your next big sales order. The key to a great presentation is confidence.

In this training course, Chris Croft gives you a series of tips and tricks, emphasizing practical techniques you can use before and during a presentation to maximize its effectiveness. Learn how to calm your pre-talk nerves, practice proper body language, write effective openers, manage the time you're allotted, and close strong. Plus, find out how to get more out of PowerPoint and engage your audience by asking the right questions.
