[Course_Description]
As a product manager, you serve as the diplomat of the product team. You're tasked with communicating with stakeholders inside the product team, outside the product team, and even outside the company. By understanding how to communicate with each of these stakeholders in terms of what they care about, you'll be able to build better products and get more accomplished. In this course, Jay Clouse reviews the roles and responsibilities of the typical product team and explains the nuances of communicating with each group of stakeholders, including senior leaders, company partners such as sales and marketing, and customers themselves. The course includes real-life scenarios that show these communication strategies in action during phases of product managementâ€”including customer discovery, road mapping, and sprint planning.
