[Course_Description]
Pop Chart Lab turns complex data sets into stylish infographics, from taxonomies of hip-hop to field guides of famous felines. Find out what goes into one of its poster-size prints in this installment of Start to Finish. Founders Ben Gibson and Patrick Mulligan describe how they broke down the data for over 700 Nintendo games and reimagined it visually for their The Nebula of NES Games chart.
