[Course_Description]
Want to become a great risk-taker? Without knowing when and how to take risks, you and your organization can lose market share, relevance, and potentially become obsolete. Risk-taking is one of the greatest leadership tools available and is imperative to the long-term growth of any organization. In this course, author and innovation thought leader Deborah Perry Piscione reveals the key differences between gambling and calculated risk-taking, and how to master the skills of risk-taking. Once you as a leader have figured out how and when to take risks, you can then build a culture that not only focuses on producing the work, but also creates and executes a steady flow of ideas to improve every aspect of the organization.
