[Course_Description]
Tech is one of those rare places where demand for jobs is higher than the supply. With that in mind, how can recruiters and hiring managers get the best candidates for the job into the jobs theyâ€™re trying to fill? One way is by understanding the tech well enough to know exactly what you need. In this series of courses, instructor Ayub Shaikh goes over high-level IT concepts and breaks them into related, easy-to-remember groupings. This course introduces you to the series. Ayub defines critical terms and trends that you will need to understand, then explains how and why IT recruitment got started. He covers what IT is, shows you the basic structure of IT roles, and describes hardware and the specific skills that specific hardware may require. Note: This course was created by Holistica Consulting. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
