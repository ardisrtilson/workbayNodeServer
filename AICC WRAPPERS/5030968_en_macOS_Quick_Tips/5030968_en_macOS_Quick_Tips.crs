In this course, get bite-sized tips that can help you work more efficiently with this powerful desktop operating system from Apple. Each stand-alone video is about a minute in length, so you can quickly bolster your macOS know-how whenever you have a spare moment. Nick Brazzi shares tricks for customizing the interface, including how to change the size and position of the dock, zoom to enlarge part of the screen, and change the size and speed of your mouse cursor.
