[Course_Description]
There is plenty of opportunity to innovate even in traditional, top-down companiesâ€”even in traditionally noninnovative roles. Learn how to become an intrapreneur and lead innovation and change from inside a company. In this course, strategy consultant Robbie Baxter explains what intrapreneurship is and how innovation works inside a large organization. Discover how to gauge whether your company is ready for disruption, how to find and test ideas, how to get resources and buy-in from leadership, and how to scale your ideas so they are feasible for the entire enterprise. Robbie also discusses when to throw in the towel and when to pass off projects. Finally, she shares a few examples of successful intrapreneurship, from organizations as diverse as Adobe and the University of Pennsylvania.
