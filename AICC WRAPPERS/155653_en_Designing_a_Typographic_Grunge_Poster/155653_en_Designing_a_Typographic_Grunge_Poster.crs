[Course_Description]
Welcome to this installment of Type Project, where Nigel French shows you how to choose historically appropriate typefaces and apply design treatment to fit a particular style. Here he uses Illustrator and Photoshop to create a type treatment inspired by Grungeâ€”the style most commonly associated with the music scene that originated in Seattle in the 1980s and 90s, and continues to resonate today. Learn how to create a background wall of type using Illustrator symbols, delete the counter spaces, and distress the design with dirty type. Looking for more Type Projects?
