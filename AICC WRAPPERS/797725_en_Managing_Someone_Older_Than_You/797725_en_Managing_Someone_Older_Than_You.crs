[Course_Description]
Managing someone older can be a challenge if they have a different way of working or communicating. However, with the right leadership, generational differences can be overcomeâ€”or even transformed into benefits for your organization. This course explains how to build more effective communication and collaboration with older workers and build a harmonious and efficient multigenerational team. Instructor and career coach John Tarnoff explains how to onboard an older worker and help established employees become more engaged and more collaborative. He also explains how to overcome age bias (both towards and from older workers) and motivate older workers to be their best, sharing the wisdom that their years of experience can provide to enrich your team.
