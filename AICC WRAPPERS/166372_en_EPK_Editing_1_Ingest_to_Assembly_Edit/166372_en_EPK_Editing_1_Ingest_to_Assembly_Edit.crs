[Course_Description]
This course is the first in a series on producing content for a music video EPK, or electronic press kit, using the tools in Adobe CC. Here Maxim Jago covers the media acquisition and management stage of the process, which ends in an assembly editâ€”a rough edit that illustrates how the director would like to structure the final film. You'll learn how to use Adobe Prelude and Premiere Pro to organize mixed-media files, ingest them, transcode them, work with metadata, and use automation to speed up your edit, before preparing a simple assembly edit to present to editors or collaborators. Stay tuned for future courses in the series, which will cover the other steps in the workflow, all the way up to the finished music video.
