[Course_Description]
CINEMA 4D Essentials with Rob Garrott is a graduated introduction to this complex 3D modeling, rendering, and animation program, which breaks down into installments that can be completed within 2 hours. This edition introduces two modeling techniques: HyperNURBS, or subdivision modeling, for creating smooth rounded objects, and sculpting. Rob explains how to set up for each workflow, and how to create basic shapes and then refine them with more detailed tools. The course provides a solid foundation for designers starting to shape their creations in CINEMA 4D.
