[Course_Description]
In the past several years, a series of devastating cyberattacks have periodically dominated headlines. While each attack affected different industries and governments, they shared the same root cause: unfixed—but publicly known—vulnerabilities. In this course, get a step-by-step process for finding, prioritizing, and mitigating the vulnerabilities in your own computing environment, no matter what technology stack you're running. Instructor Kip Boyle shows how to prepare for and create a robust vulnerability management program, explaining how to set program goals and secure funding by creating a compelling business case. Kip also covers how to conduct weekly vulnerability scans, as well as mitigate any vulnerabilities that crop up. Along the way, Kip shares case studies that illustrate how a real-world organization would approach each step in this process.
