[Course_Description]
So many of us have rough recordings or bare bones song ideas just sitting on our hard drives, waiting to be finished... This course provides strategies for completing those tracks and releasing them to the world. It's based on industry pro Evan Sutton's own workflow for being a more productive, prolific music producer. Evan starts with the music production tools that can make it easier to see a song through to completion, such as templates, presets, and foolproof hardware setups. Next, he gets into the heavy lifting, mixing both songwriting and production techniques with tips for dealing with the psychological factors that may trip you up when completing a song. He wraps up the course with techniques that help to clear the final steps of song completion, including building transitions, adding ear candy, mixing strategies for increased efficiency, and simple mastering techniques, whether you choose to master your tracks yourself or hire a professional.
