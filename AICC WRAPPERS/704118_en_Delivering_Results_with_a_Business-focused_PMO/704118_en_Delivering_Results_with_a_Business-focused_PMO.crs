[Course_Description]
Having a business-focused project management office, or PMO, is critical. The PMO must align with the business—and deliver on the value it promises—if it is going to succeed. This course explains how to transform a traditional PMO into one that concentrates on execution, results, and, above all, business value. Join Andy Jordan, global PMO and project management thought leader, as he defines the roles, relationships, techniques, and benefits of the business-focused PMO. Andy explains how to align with the priorities and performance expectations of your organization, position the PMO within the business, deliver value, and adopt an effective staffing model. Using these techniques, you can turn your PMO from an office of oversight into an indispensible arm of the business.
