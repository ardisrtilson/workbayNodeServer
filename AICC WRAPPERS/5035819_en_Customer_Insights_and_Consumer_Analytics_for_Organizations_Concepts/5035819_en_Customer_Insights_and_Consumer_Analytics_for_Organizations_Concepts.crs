In today's business landscape, companies in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer verticals are adjusting to a new reality in which user information abounds. This means realigning the customer interest as the center point in making important decisionsâ€”which, in turn, requires a new set of skills.

Instructor Chris DallaVilla helps executives and members of organizational teams get up to speed on best practices for processes and procedures, driving target outcomes, establishing infrastructure, and defining policies for data privacy, security, and ethics.
