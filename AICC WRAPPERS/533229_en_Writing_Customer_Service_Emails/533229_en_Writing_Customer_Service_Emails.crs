You can write to customers—via email—with consistency and professionalism, but you don't need to sound robotic to be efficient. Writing instructor Leslie O'Flahavan has real customer service emails she shares with you in this course, so you can see how to communicate with clarity and sincerity to help customers feel heard and ensure your responses provide the help they need. Leslie shares techniques customer service agents can apply that help build strong practices in a contact center and improve customer relations.
