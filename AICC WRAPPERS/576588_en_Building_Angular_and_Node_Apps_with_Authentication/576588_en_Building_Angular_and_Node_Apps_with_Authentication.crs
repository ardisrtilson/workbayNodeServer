[Course_Description]
Are you already familiar with Angular 2 and Node.js? If so, this course can help you leverage these two popular frameworks to build a full-stack web applicationâ€”which you can later use as a template for your own web app. Join Alexander Zanfir as he shows how to create and configure an Angular 2 project, display data in Angular 2, get your data from Node.js, and save your data to Node.js. He also covers how to create a form in Angular, set up routes, validate with reactive forms, register users, and more.
