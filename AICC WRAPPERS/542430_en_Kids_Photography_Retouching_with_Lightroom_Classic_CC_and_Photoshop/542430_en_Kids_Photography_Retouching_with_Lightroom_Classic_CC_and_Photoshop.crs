[Course_Description]
Photographing kids comes with a unique set of challenges. The best portrait of a kid might be a quirky shot of a kid with a funny expression—not usually what you're looking for in adult portraiture. When it comes to retouching, you're more likely to be cleaning up a runny nose than softening wrinkles. In this course, photographer Erika Thornes shows how to review a kid photo shoot to find the best shot of the bunch. Then, she dives into Lightroom Classic CC and Photoshop and details a variety of retouching challenges and solutions—including cleaning up that messy nose.
