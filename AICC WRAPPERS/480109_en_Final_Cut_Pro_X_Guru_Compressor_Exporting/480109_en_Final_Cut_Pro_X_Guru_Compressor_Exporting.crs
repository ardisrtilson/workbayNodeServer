[Course_Description]
Compressor extends the capabilities of Final Cut Pro X, allowing you greater control when sending out your final projects. In this course, Nick Harauz shows how to set up Compressor presets and templates to transcode and encode media for different formats, including broadcast, web, and mobile devices, and add metadata, captions, color correction effects, timecodes, and watermarks to your video. With these compression tips, you'll end up with more high-quality renders from your Final Cut Pro projects, and spend less time meddling with settings.
