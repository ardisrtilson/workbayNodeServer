[Course_Description]
What if you could profoundly change your life by becoming more mindful? What if paying attention on purpose could improve your health? In Mindfulness for Beginners, Jon Kabat-Zinn—the scientist, bestselling author, and teacher who brought mindfulness meditation into the mainstream—gives you immediate access to a practice that can potentially add years to your life and enhance the quality of every day. Explore five guided meditations based on Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), a program offered in medical clinics and hospitals around the world. Cultivate the seven key attitudinal factors of MBSR—qualities of heart and mind that lay the foundation for mindfulness. Use these lessons to free yourself from limiting perspectives and become more intimate with your own boundless awareness. This course was created by Sounds True. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
