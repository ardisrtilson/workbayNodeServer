[Course_Description]
Time-lapse photography allows Dustin Farrell to capture amazing imagery that no other medium allows—and that even eludes the human eye. He can track the passage of clouds and stars, and document the tiny changes in landscapes and everyday scenes over time. Find out how he shoots his time-lapse photos and reassembles them into remarkable films in this installment of Start to Finish. We follow Dustin into the desert of Devil's Garden in southwestern Utah, to find out how he transports and sets up the equipment required to capture his shots—from dollies and motion controllers to LED lights and camping lanterns. Back in the studio, he demonstrates how he realizes his vision with tools like Adobe Camera Raw and After Effects. Although the process may be long and unpredictable, in the end he has a final sequence that is otherworldly—rendered with real-world technology.
