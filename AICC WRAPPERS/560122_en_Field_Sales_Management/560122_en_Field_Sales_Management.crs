[Course_Description]
Whether you're leading a small team of in-house salespeople or a global team of 100 or more, the skills you need to be a successful manager are the same. That said, managing a remote field sales organization requires a unique leadership connection. This isn't a role you just jump into. You need training to acquire specific skills, as well as time to learn the balance of leading, letting people do their job, and reporting into your company. In this course, follow sales coach Dean Karrel as he explains what's unique about training, managing, and leading field salespeople. He covers topics such as the importance of giving field salespeople their independence, communicating remotely, the challenges of CRM, the need for travel, guiding your team through tough times, and managing performance from a distance.
