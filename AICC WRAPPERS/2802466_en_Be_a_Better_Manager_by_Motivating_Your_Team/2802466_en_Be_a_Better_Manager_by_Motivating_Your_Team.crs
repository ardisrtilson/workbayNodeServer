[Course_Description]
While management is driven by goals and vision, managing is about people. Effective managers understand themselves and their team members. This understanding facilitates communication, motivation, and successful collaboration. In this course, leadership experts—like former NBA commissioner David Stern and bestselling author David Pink—explain how to best motivate your team. Discover how to identify and work with different personality types and structure teams that balance autonomy with accountability. Learn how to recognize four common communication styles, micromanage selectively, increase low motivation, and develop mediocre employees into high performers. By the end, you’ll have the tools you need to graduate from a manager to a true leader who can develop your team’s talent and performance. This course includes videos from: David Stern, former NBA commissioner Linda A. Hill, professor at Harvard Business School Carson Tate, author and productivity consultant (Work Simply) Daniel H. Pink, bestselling author (Drive and A Whole New Mind) Lisa Bodell, CEO of FutureThink Note: This course was produced by Big Think. We are pleased to host this content in our library.
