[Course_Description]
What is layout? Layout is the use of type, graphics, and space to create story, voice, and engagement. It is one of the core tools of graphic design. Join John McWade as he teaches the basic rules for achieving a balanced, professional, and attractive layout. It starts with the page itself: a space with visible and invisible properties. Learn the core principles that keep a layout simple and strong. Then find out how to use white space and images effectively and explore the power and flexibility of grids. John also provides two start-to-finish projects, which show how these design principles play out in real-world layouts.
