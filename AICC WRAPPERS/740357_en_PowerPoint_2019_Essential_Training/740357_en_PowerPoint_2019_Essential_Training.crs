[Course_Description]
You don't have to be a designer to create a great-looking presentation. Learn how to use Microsoft PowerPoint 2019 to quickly create, edit, and share polished and professional presentations. In this training course, Jess Stratton shows how to get started with PowerPoint templates and themes or build a new presentation from scratch. Next, learn how to add, remove, and rearrange slides and change the slide layout. Jess then demonstrates how to add and edit text, images, charts, video, audio, and animation; format slides for consistency; and add speaker notes and comments to ensure a smooth delivery. Plus, discover how to collaborate on changes and then share the final presentation via print, PDF, or as a recorded slideshow. By the end of the course, you'll know how to use the PowerPoint tools and a few simple design rules to draw attention to your message and deliver a presentation that shines.
