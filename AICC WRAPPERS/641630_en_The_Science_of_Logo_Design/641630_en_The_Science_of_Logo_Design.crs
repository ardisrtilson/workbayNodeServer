[Course_Description]
Logo design requires artistry, but did you know your logos can also benefit from science? In this course, William Lidwell introduces the whys behind well-known guidelines, and even debunks a few outdated design myths along the way. He reviews the four principles that make a logo ARMM'd for use: attention, response, meaning, and memory. By using these tips, you can bring scientific rigor to your logos, and start designing on evidenceâ€”not industry hearsay. This course was created and produced by William Lidwell. We're pleased to host this training in our library.
