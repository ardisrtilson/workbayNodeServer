[Course_Description]
No workplace is immune from accidents. From worksites full of hazards like construction sites or warehouses, to seemingly benign places like your average office, accidents just happen. And while you may not spend your days worrying about slips, trips, or short falls, these are some of the most frequent injuries and can be serious enough to require medical attention and time off work. In this course, construction safety consultant Jim Rogers covers slips, trips, and falls, where they tend to occur, and their impact on the employee and the workplace. Jim provides an understanding of how both working conditions and physical structure of the jobsite can present hazards, and details policies, practices, and technology (such as personal protective equipment) that can limit the danger.
