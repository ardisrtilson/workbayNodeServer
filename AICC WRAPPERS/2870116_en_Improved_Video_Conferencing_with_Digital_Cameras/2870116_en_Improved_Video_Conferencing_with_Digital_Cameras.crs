[Course_Description]
Video conference calls have replaced many of our in-person meetings. This course is designed to help you improve your appearance and audio online as easily as possible. Instructor Derrick Story explains the advantages of digital cameras over built-in webcams and offers advice on whether or not to use your smartphone as a webcam. He shows you some things to look for in selecting the right camera and lens for you, then explains how you can adjust aperture setting, lighting, and color to look your best. Audio is just as important as video for conference calls, and Derrick steps you through how to select the right mic for your needs and shows how earbuds with mics and AirPods can be reasonable alternatives to USB mics. Creating a background that isn't distracting will help others focus on you and what you are saying. Derrick concludes by giving you useful tips on how to control your background and limit distractions.
