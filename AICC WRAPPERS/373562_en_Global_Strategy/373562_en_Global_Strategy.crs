[Course_Description]
Globalization is a double-edged sword. Global firms benefit from a larger market, scale- and location-based cost efficiencies, and exposure to a multiplicity of new product and process ideas. However, globalization also exposes firms to numerous challenges resulting from a dramatic increase in diversity, complexity, and uncertainty. This course is aimed at helping managers learn how to maximize the benefits while minimizing the costs and risks associated with global expansion. Anil K. Gupta, Michael Dingman Chair in Strategy and Globalization at The University of Maryland's Smith School, and a leading expert on global strategy, outlines the logic of global strategy and the questions you must address in order to globalize your company's market presence and leverage global resources.
