[Course_Description]
It's a common scenario: Everything about a photo works, except for the sky. Maybe it's overexposed because of the way your camera metered. Or maybe it's just bland. Not to worry. With Photoshop you can replace a sky that doesn't work with one that does. In this course, photographer, author, and educator Seán Duggan shows you how to perform this common compositing task. You'll see examples of sky replacements that don't work, and then learn how to create ones that do. Get a photographer's insight on masking, lighting, and blending adjustments naturally into the background of an existing photo.
