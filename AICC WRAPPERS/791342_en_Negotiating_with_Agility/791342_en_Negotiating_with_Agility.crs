[Course_Description]
Negotiation is dynamic, fast paced, and uncertain. Agility is crucial to success. The best negotiators avoid one-size-fits-all solutions; instead, they use agile strategies to avoid obstacles and capitalize on unexpected opportunities. In this course, Michael Wheeler—Harvard Business School professor and negotiation expert—shares the strategies of agile negotiation with you. Learn how to ask penetrating questions, improvise, say yes and no the right way, and adapt your strategy over time. The skills you build in this course can help you close deals that might otherwise slip through your fingers, craft creative agreements that advance everyone's interests, and resolve minor differences before they escalate into costly disputes. Each lesson is illustrated with real-life examples and exercises to practice what you've learned in your own negotiations, large and small.
