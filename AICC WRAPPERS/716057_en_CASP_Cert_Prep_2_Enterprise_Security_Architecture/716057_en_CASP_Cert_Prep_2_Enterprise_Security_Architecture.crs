Jason teaches you how to choose the correct solutions to architect a secure enterprise network and support the business's operational needs. He covers hardware such as routers and switches, servers, mobile phones, and smart devices, as well as the applications that run on them. At the end of the course, you should be able to understand the proper placement and integration of technical security controls, and also be prepared to answer critical questions from this section of the CompTIA CASP+ certification exam.
