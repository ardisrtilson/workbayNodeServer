Are you an accounts receivable manager or supervisor? If so, then you know how important it is to understand how your accounts receivable process is performing. This course from Michael Management shows you how to use Fiori Accounts Payable analytical apps to create dashboards and monitor the performance of your accounts payable process. The course introduces you to SAP Fiori and explains what it is and where to get it. Then, through videos and demos, the course walks you through how to monitor aging analysis, processing analysis, supplier open payments analysis, and days payable outstanding.
