[Course_Description]
Want to give your iOS app the ability to store local, encrypted data like IDs, passwords, or credits card numbers? In this course, instructor Bear Cahill shows you how. Bear demonstrates how to leverage the iOS keychain, which allows you to give your apps a mechanism to store bits of user data in an encrypted database. Using practical examples, he explains how to store keychain values, as well as how to retrieve, update, delete, and share data from the keychain. He wraps up with a series of code-based challenges and solutions that help you put these new concepts into practice. After completing this course, you'll have the knowledge you need to write code to use the keychain in your own iOS apps.
