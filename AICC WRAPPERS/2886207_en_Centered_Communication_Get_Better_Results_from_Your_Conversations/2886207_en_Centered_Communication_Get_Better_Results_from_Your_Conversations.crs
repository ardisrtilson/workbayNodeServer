[Course_Description]
Effective communication is a learned skill, not something that you are naturally born with. In this course, communication coach TJ Guttormsen helps you to understand the fundamentals of centered communication and equips you with practical techniques to build conversations that are more likely to yield great results professionally and privately. TJ begins with basics like how to interact with intent, make the right first impression, and analyze your own sub-communicative skills. He goes over a variety of useful conversation techniques, then concludes with practical steps you can take to practice your techniques in the real world.
