[Course_Description]
Take a look behind the scenes at the production of a real-world television commercial. Learn what it takes to plan, shoot, edit, and deliver a public service announcement for delivery to broadcast and the web. In this course, author Rich Harrington takes an in-depth look at a real-world PSA that his company, RHED Pixel, made for a nonprofit client. The chapters mimic the stages of the project itself: preproduction (planning and design), production (shooting the scenes), and post (where the footage is edited, graded, and compressed for delivery). Each step is full of shortcuts for saving time and maximizing efficiency on set, and ideas you can use on your own commercials.
