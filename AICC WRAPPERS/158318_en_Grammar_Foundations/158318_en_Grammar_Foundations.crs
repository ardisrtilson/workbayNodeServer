[Course_Description]
Grammar matters! Why? Proper grammar improves the clarity of your writing and increases readers' confidence in your ideas. But memorizing every single grammar rule is not the purpose of this course. Instead, author Judy Steiner-Williams concentrates on helping you apply the basic principles so you can avoid making the most common mistakes. Learn about the different parts of speech, possessive rules, and the difference between writing vs. spelling numbers. Then discover tricks for using words that look alike or sound alike (but have entirely different meanings) and enforcing parallel structure.
