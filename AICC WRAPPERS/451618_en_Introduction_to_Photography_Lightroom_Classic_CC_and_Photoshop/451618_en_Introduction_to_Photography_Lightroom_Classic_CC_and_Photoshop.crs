[Course_Description]
Your work (and play) as a photographer doesn't end when you press the shutter button. With software such as Adobe's high-powered Lightroom Classic CC and Photoshop apps, you can enhance and transform your photos to fix problems, improve composition and exposure, and so much more. Where to begin learning tools like these? Right here. In this course, photographer, author, and educator Ben Long introduces the concepts and creative options behind photographic post-processing. From fixing problems to retouching, Ben shows how to do it, without overdoing it, with Lightroom Classic CC, Photoshop, and the Adobe mobile apps.
