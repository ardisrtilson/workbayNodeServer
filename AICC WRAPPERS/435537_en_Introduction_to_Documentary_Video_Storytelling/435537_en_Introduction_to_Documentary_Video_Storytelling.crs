[Course_Description]
Introduction to Documentary Video Storytelling breaks down the narrative elements of documentary film. Staff author Ashley Kennedy explores the grammar and story structure of nonfiction filmmaking, and discusses how history and technology have impacted how today's documentary filmmakers shoot and edit their projects. She examines the many different styles and modes of documentary filmmaking—from expository to observational to participatory—and more. Along the way, she references several dozen clips from well-known and award-winning documentaries throughout the last 120 years of cinema.
