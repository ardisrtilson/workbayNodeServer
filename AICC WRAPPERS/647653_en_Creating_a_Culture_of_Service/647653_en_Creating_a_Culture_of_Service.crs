[Course_Description]
A culture of service extends far beyond your customer service department. Developing a service-oriented organization or team requires clarity of messaging and operating through a lens of impact. In this course, leadership consultants Lisa Earle McLeod and Elizabeth McLeod help leaders communicate their customer-focused purpose and outline processes and policies that support these values. They share how exceptional leaders help their teams shine, and how making some small—but meaningful—changes to how you talk about money, mistakes, and even the firing of employees can make a big difference in the engagement and performance of your team.
