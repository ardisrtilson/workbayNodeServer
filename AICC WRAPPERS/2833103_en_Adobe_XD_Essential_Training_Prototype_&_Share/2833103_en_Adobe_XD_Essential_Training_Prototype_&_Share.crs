Fixing a fundamental mistake in a web app after it has been released can be costly and time-consuming. In this course—the final installment in a two-part series—learn how to avoid such problems by building a high-fidelity, fully interactive prototype that can help you spot issues early in the design process. Instructor Dani Beaumont, a principal product manager on Adobe XD, shares insider tips for creating, sharing, and revising prototypes effectively for user research and testing projects using Adobe XD. Learn how to add animation and motion to your project with Auto-Animate. Discover how to share your prototype and preview it on a variety of devices. Plus, learn how to share your prototypes with developers via design spec links, where they can get all the info they need, including assets.
