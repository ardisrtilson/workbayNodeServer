[Course_Description]
Leverage the advanced features in Trimble Accubid Classic Pro—the powerful electrical estimating software—to more efficiently complete bid estimates. Throughout this course, instructor Christopher Randall helps you learn your way around some of the more complex features of the software. Discover how to copy and paste items within an estimate (and from another estimate), use audit trail breakdowns, and sort and filter the extension screen. Plus, learn how to create reverse takeoffs, create and use sub jobs and master jobs, and apply cost values to different elements of an estimate.
