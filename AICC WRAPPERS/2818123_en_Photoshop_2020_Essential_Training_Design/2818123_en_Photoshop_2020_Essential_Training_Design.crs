Adobe Photoshop is the industry standard for image editing and manipulation and used by a full spectrum of design professionals. This course was created specifically to help designers master the most commonly used tools and techniques with the goal of removing technical barriers in order to start creating as soon as possible. Photoshop 2020 boasts even more tools, and enhancements for selecting and masking images, removing distracting elements, and warping imagesâ€”all while maintaining the highest-quality output. In this course, Julieanne Kost demonstrates how to efficiently work with presets, Smart Objects, and filters; distort and warp layer; create text, shapes, and vector paths; build animations; apply painterly effects; save and share libraries; and work with artboards.
