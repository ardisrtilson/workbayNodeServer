[Course_Description]
Expand your SOLIDWORKS 3D CAD skills by learning how to design a machine with moving parts. In this course, learn through designing the components of an early-19th-century rival to the steam engine. Follow along with Johno Ellison as he leads you through the steps for creating a Stirling engine, a closed-cycle heat engine invented by Robert Stirling in 1816. Johno shows how to use SOLIDWORKS to create all the parts, combine the parts into an assembly, and prepare drawings for the final product. Johno also provides tips and ideas for moving the creation from a virtual to physical design.
