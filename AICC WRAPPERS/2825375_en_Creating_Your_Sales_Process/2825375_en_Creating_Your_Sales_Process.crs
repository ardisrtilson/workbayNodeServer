[Course_Description]
The sales process is the foundation for sales success. There are many methodologies and theories, but every process is based around the same basic steps. This course provides a 10-step framework that can be followed no matter what program you may use in the future: from assessing need and presenting a product or service to closing the sale and reporting back to your company. Sales leader and coach Dean Karrel concentrates on sales development—gathering information to evaluate potential clients and aligning the products or services that can be offered—and continuous improvement. These investments make the actual sale the easiest step of all! By customizing the complete framework, you will be able to create a solid sales process that works for all your accounts.
