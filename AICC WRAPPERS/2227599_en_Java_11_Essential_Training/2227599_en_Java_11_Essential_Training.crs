[Course_Description]
If you want to build applications for mobile devices, desktop computers, or the web, you need to know Java. This course provides the foundation for learning how to program with the most recent Long-Term Support (LTS) release, Java SE 11, and more recent versions. David Gassner shows how to install Java and the IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition IDE and start working with variables, data types, and other critical language components. He also helps you control program flow with conditional logic and loops, store data with Java collections, and understand how Java implements object-oriented coding principles such as inheritance.
