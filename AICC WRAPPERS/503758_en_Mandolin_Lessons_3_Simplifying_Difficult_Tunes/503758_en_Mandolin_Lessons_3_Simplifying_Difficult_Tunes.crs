[Course_Description]
What does it take to become an advanced mandolin player like Grammy nominee Mike Marshall? Once you've mastered the basics, you may want to take on some more difficult tunes. This course, the third in the Mandolin Lessons series, helps you break down popular but challenging songs like Ride the Wild Turkey and build your speed, dexterity, and ability to improvise. Learn how to incorporate a metronome into your practice, play advanced arpeggios, and use open and closed finger positioning to navigate complex chord charges. In chapter 3, Mike goes in the opposite direction: making simple tunes more interesting. Learn how to spice up basic songs with embellishments, slides, hammer-ons, and pull-offs; play four-finger scales; and reharmonize traditional melodies. Make sure to check out the exercise files for downloadable tab, audio samples, and other study materials to assist your practice. Note: This course was created and produced by ArtistWorks.
