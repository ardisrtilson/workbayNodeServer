[Course_Description]
Action hooks and filters give developers the ability to extend and customize WordPress, the world's most popular content management system. This course teaches you how to write action and filter code to modify WordPress core, themes, and plugins. Instructor Carrie Dils explains how action hooks and filters work and shows how to leverage priorities, arguments, and conditionals for more precise control over when your code executes. Next, learn how to identify the available hooks and filters for different WordPress pages, invoke callback functions, and execute hooks. In the third chapter, Carrie introduces a start-to-finish project where she shows how to build a simple plugin with hooks and filters, and closes with some tips for using third-party developer hooksâ€”and creating your own.
