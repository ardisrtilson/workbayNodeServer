[Course_Description]
We are wired for story. We crave it. Storytelling has played an integral role in our ability to make progress as a species. It should come as no surprise, then, that presenting data and information in story form maximizes the effectiveness of our communication. We can create deeper emotional responses in our audience when we present data in story form. Join data visualization expert Bill Shander as he guides you through the process of turning facts and figures into story to engage and fulfill our human expectation for information. This course is intended for anyone who works with data and has to communicate it to others, whether a researcher, a data analyst, a consultant, a marketer, or a journalist. Bill shows you how to think about, and craft, stories from data by examining many compelling stories in detail.
