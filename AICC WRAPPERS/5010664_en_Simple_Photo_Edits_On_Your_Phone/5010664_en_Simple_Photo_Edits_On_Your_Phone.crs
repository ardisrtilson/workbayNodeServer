You don’t always need a fancy camera to produce stellar pictures. Using a few simple editing tools, you can enhance the photos in your mobile phone by making small, straightforward adjustments. Whether you want to highlight a product on your website, showcase a finished dish for your food blog, create a cohesive brand on Instagram, or just improve photos for fun, this course can help. Join instructor Tracey Clark as she shows how to improve your photos using editing tools most people already have, such as your phone’s built-in editor. Discover how to enhance a poorly lit photo, improve a headshot by cropping it, change a photo’s tone to better represent your brand, improve your group photos, enhance your travel photography, and more.
