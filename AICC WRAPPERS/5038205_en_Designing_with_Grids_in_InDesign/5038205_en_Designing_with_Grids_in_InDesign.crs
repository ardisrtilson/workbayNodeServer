[Course_Description]
Take the guesswork out of your InDesign layouts. Whether it's a business card, a poster, a digital magazine, or a printed book, your design will look better if you use a grid. Join designer Nigel French as he takes you through a brief history of gridsâ€”why you should use them and when you should break them. He shows you how to establish margins and columns, set up a modular grid, and how to fit text to a baseline grid. Plus, learn how to use the powerful Gridify tool and break the grid for graphic effect using images.
