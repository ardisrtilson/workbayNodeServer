[Course_Description]
Curious how physical scale models go from the drawing board to the display table at a client meeting? In this course, get an expert's take on how professionals approach the model-building process. Instructor Olivia Morgan takes you through each step of the workflow, showing you how to use Rhino to design a digital file of a building for the physical fabrication of a scale model. Olivia begins by covering general model-building methods, as well as how to compose a digital file for different fabrication options. She goes over the best import and post-processing methods when working with files types outside of Rhino. Using an imported base model, Olivia demonstrates how to rebuild a model out of puzzle pieces that will be fabricated and reassembled physically. Plus, get best practices for laying out your materials for laser cutting.
