[Course_Description]
Interested in producing the next chart-topping pop song? Or simply using classic pop techniques to blend the many different elements of today's modern multitrack recording sessions into one seamless song? In this course, multi-platinum producer, engineer, and mixer Brian Malouf demonstrates his hit-making mixing techniques. These lessons can be used on pop, jazz, country, folk, or any other recordings you want to turn into solid two-track stereo mixes. Brian starts with the basics of creating a mix template and getting a good raw balance of the instruments in the mix. He then dives deep into signal processing techniques on many types of instruments, including drums, bass, guitar, keys, vocals, percussion, strings, and brass. He'll pick out and treat individual tracks with compression and EQ, add space with reverb and echo, and modulate the sound with flangers and phase shifters. Pro Tools is used throughout the course, but the techniques will work equally well with the DAW of your choice.
