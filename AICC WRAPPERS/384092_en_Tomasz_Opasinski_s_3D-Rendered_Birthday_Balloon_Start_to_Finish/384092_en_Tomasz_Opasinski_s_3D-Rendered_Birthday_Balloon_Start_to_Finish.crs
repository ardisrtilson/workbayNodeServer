[Course_Description]
Photoshop turns 25 in 2015. In honor of the occasion, movie poster designer Tomasz Opasinski creates a unique 3D birthday card for Photoshop. He uses an amazing piece of 3D graffiti he created in CINEMA 4D and uses Photoshop to reimagine it: changing the lighting and shadows, introducing some storytelling elements, wrapping type onto the balloon, and making the whole look more organic with filters. Follow along as Tomasz explains how he took his poster-size love letter to Photoshop from start to finish.
