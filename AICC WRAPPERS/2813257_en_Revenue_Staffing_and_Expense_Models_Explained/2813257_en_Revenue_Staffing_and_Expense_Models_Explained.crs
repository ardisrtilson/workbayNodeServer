[Course_Description]
Revenue forecasting is a form of predicting the futureâ€”which makes it intimidating and may be why so many entrepreneurs hazard wild guesses to get it over with as fast as they can. But tying income projections directly to marketing and sales activities and using industry research to justify growth predictions is essential if you want to transform your revenue model into a useful tool for tracking performance and staying on top of your cash flow. In this course, you can look at what drivers create revenue; which revenue models work best for product, service, and subscription or membership businesses; and how to predict how fast your business will scale. Detailed worksheets accompanying this course help you develop your own models that are succinct, understandable, accurate, and actionable. This course was created by EntrepreneurNOW.
