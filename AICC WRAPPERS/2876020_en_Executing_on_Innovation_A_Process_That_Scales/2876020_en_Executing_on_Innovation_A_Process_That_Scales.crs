[Course_Description]
New ideas and bold bets are essential for the livelihood and survival of any organization operating in today’s competitive marketplace and era of exponential growth. On the minds of many leaders are questions like, “How do I know where the next big idea is?” and “What are the incremental or groundbreaking ideas that can be cultivated from my employees?” In this course, innovation thought leader Deborah Perry Piscione shares her bottom-up proprietary methodology that engages all the talents of the entire organization. As Deborah explains, leaders know that without nurturing big ideas, topline expansion is limited. This process helps an organization shift to a growth mode, and addresses the question on how to identify, source, data-mine, and execute upon new ideas from any employee in every corner of the company.
