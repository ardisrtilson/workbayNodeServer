Although GoPro HERO cameras are typically used for sports and action shots, the truth is they're useful in any scenario that might challenge your regular DSLR or video camera. Think underwater shoots, down and (literally) dirty perspectives, and quadcopter-mounted aerial video and photography. It sounds like an ideal set of challenges for photojournalist Paul Taggart, who also shoots video for the Discovery Channel and other media outlets. In this course, he takes us to a farming community in the state of Washington to showcase creative uses for the GoPro HERO, in a variety of situations. He goes deep at a shellfish farm, gets footage from the tractor's perspective at an organic farm, and mounts the GoPro to a quadcopter to get aerial footage at a vineyard. At the end of each chapter, he recaps the shoot and reviews the final still photos and video.
