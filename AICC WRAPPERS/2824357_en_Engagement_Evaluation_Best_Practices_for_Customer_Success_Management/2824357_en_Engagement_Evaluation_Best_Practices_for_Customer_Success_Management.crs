[Course_Description]
Becoming a proficient customer success manager (CSM) cannot happen overnight. Once you've learned the basic processes and best practices for the core CSM activities, you then need to practice by testing your knowledge in real, customer-facing situations. In this way, you can gain experience and learn lessons to refine, improve, and hone your capabilities. But it's not enough just to do the work. Alongside the preparation, onboarding, adoption, and value realization activities that CSMs perform as they work with their customers, they also need to evaluate their own performance as a CSM—as well as how a client engagement has fared overall—in order to determine what's working and what's not. Then, the CSM can take proactive steps to repeat what works and fix what doesn't. This course can be taken on its own or as one in a series of courses from PracticalCSM.com that build upon each other to cover the entirety of CSM best practices in greater detail.
