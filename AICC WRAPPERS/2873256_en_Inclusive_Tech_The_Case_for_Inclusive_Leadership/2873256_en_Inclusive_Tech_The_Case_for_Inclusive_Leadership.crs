Inclusive leadership in technology can offer business, ethical, and social benefits. But what does it mean to be inclusive, why does it matter, and how do you get started? This course provides a bridge for technology managers and motivated team leaders to enter diversity, inclusion, and belonging (DIBs) training. Instructor Jessica Rose takes you through the case for inclusive leadership, what it means for a new team versus an established team, and the real challenges leaders can face around inclusivity. Jessica concludes with a look at the bigger picture in tech, reinforcing why it is everyone's responsibility to build a better future for technology.
