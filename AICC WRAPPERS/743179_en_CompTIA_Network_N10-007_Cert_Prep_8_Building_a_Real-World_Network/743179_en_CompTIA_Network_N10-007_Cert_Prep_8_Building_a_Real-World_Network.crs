Jump-start your career in IT by earning the CompTIA Network+ certification, one of the most sought-after certifications for networking professionals. In this installment of the nine-part CompTIA Network+ Cert Prep series, instructor Mike Meyers covers key networking exam concepts as he steps through how to design and build a real-world network. Here, Mike compares and contrasts the characteristics of network topologies, types, and technologies—helping to prepare you for the corresponding exam objective in the process. He familiarizes you with the different types of networks; goes over key aspects of network design; shares how to create an effective contingency plan; describes the when, why, and how of backups; and more.
