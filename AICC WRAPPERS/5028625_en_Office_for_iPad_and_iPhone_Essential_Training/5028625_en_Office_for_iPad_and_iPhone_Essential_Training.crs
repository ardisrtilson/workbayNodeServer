Plan your week and finish your projects on the go with the Office mobile apps. Microsoft offers the same great productivity tools you use on your desktop in a suite of free apps designed specifically for iOS. In this course, Jess Stratton shows you how to use the latest features of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneDrive, and Outlook on your iPhone or iPad. Jess explores the shared common interface conventions, and then dives into the unique features of each app. Find out how to create great looking Word documents, build spreadsheets and charts in Excel, present slideshows from PowerPoint, and not only check your email, but also collaborate on files using Outlook and Teams.
