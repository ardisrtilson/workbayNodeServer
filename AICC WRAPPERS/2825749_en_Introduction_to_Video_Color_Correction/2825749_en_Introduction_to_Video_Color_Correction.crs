[Course_Description]
Do you want to make your video footage look more vibrant, more accurate, or better fit the mood and themes of your project? Color correction helps you accomplish all these goals and more. In this introductory course, instructor Ashley Kennedy explains the concepts behind color correction and color grading, and she guides editors through the process of correcting contrast, color balance, and hue/saturation. Ashley uses real-world examples to stress the aesthetics, basic measurement requirements, and overall techniques of the color correction process. After a thorough introduction of how to correct individual shots, she discusses the importance of shot-to-shot correction, as well as troubleshooting common lighting and color problems to create overall “looks” for a film.
