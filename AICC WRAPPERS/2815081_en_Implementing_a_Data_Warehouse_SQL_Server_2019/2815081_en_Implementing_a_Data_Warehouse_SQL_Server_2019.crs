[Course_Description]
Dimensional models like data warehouses can provide a more accessible and consistent form of data storage than relational databases. You can consolidate data from multiple sources into a single repository for business intelligence, analysis, and reporting. This course explains how to create a long-term data storage solution using local SQL Server instances and Azure SQL Data Warehouse. Instructor Adam Wilbert shows how to build a data warehouse from the ground up, starting with the tables and views; establish control flow; enforce data quality; and use your data in services such as SQL Server Reporting Services and Power BI. By the end of the course, you will be able to implement a robust, custom solution to serve all your organizationâ€™s business intelligence, reporting, and analysis needs.
