[Course_Description]
Even if you went to school for animation, the terminology can be confusing: follow through, anticipation, timing, and spacing. This fun, 5-day challenge concentrates on the basic principles of animation. Follow along with motion graphics veteran EJ Hassenfratz as he explains the concepts and asks you to put what you've learned into practice. In just 5 days, you'll have a broader understanding of just what makes certain animations successful and why! We encourage you to showcase your work online using the hashtag #5dayMograph, to get feedback on your work and stay inspired. You can also submit your projects to our Tumblr page at 5daymograph.tumblr.com.
