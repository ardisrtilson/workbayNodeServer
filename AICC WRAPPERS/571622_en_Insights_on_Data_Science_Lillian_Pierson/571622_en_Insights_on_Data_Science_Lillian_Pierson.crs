[Course_Description]
Data science is a rapidly expanding field offering a wealth of possibilities for viewing the world around us through a more accurate lens. But for many of those whose imagination is sparked by big data—but who have already started pursuing a career in another field—the dream of becoming a data scientist can feel far-fetched. Lillian Pierson, P.E.—a leading expert in the field of big data and data science—aims to prove that notion wrong. In this course, she shares observations and tips to help you embark on a career in this exciting field, regardless of your starting point. Lillian began her career not as a data scientist, but as an environmental engineer. Here, she shares her story, discussing how she taught herself to code in Python and R, and work with data science methodologies. As a result of her own experiences, Lillian is passionate about helping those interested in data science—but who may lack a four-year degree in the discipline—get started in the field. She shares practical ways to acquire the skills and experience needed to become a data scientist, and best practices for landing a job. Lillian also dives into grappling with the challenges that occur in rapidly evolving tech workforces. Plus, she discusses the industry itself, covering recent changes in the field and areas of need, and clearing up a few common misconceptions.
