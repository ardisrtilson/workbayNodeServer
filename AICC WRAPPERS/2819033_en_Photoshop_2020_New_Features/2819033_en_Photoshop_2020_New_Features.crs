[Course_Description]
2020 is the 30th anniversary edition of Photoshop. In honor of this milestone, Adobe has released an ambitious upgrade, packed with innovations and enhancements. In this course, expert Deke McClelland helps you get the most out of every new feature in the software. He reviews the automated Object Selection tool. He shows you Quilt Warp, a feature that allows point-by-point control over image distortion. He reviews the new Gradients, Patterns, and Shapes panels, which have been moved from the Preset Manager to positions of prominence. Plus, find out to save and share images in the new PSDC file format using Cloud Documents. And preview Photoshop for the iPad! Like the Creative Cloud, this course will keep evolving.
