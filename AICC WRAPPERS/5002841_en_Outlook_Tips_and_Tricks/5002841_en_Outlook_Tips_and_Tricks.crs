[Course_Description]
Learn tips, tricks, and shortcuts that will make you an Outlook power user. In this course, Gini von Courter shows how to save time, increase productivity, and keep yourself organized with Outlook. Gini begins with her top 10 productivity tips, and then shows how to quickly organize your inbox and manage incoming messages. Gini also shows how to manage appointments, work with contacts, and integrate your tasks with the rest of Outlook. Each video is standalone; you can watch the entire course or focus on just the information you need. Note that the training is recorded in Outlook for Office 365, but anyone using a recent version of Outlook—including 2019, 2016, and 2013—will be able to follow along.
