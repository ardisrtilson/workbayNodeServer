[Course_Description]
Of all the changes, promotions, and advancements you may receive at work, few are as impactful as the change from individual contributor to manager. Besides a whole host of new responsibilities, being a manager requires an entirely new way of approaching your job, and some may make that transition easier than others. In this course, Jenny Blake helps those whose job it is to support this role—manager of managers, HR—by offering a plan of action to help new managers make the big leap into their new role. She covers the importance of helping new managers form a mindset that prioritizes outcome over individual contributions, how to help new managers build confidence, and how to foster experimentation so that they can find what works best for them. This course gives you the tools to help acclimate new managers and shift their focus from working in the team, to working on the team.
