[Course_Description]
Training is hard; measuring the effectiveness of training is even harder. Learn how to explain the value of your L&D program by tracking the metrics that matter. In this course, instructor Ajay Pangarkar explains how to measure training effectiveness on four levels. First, find out how to evaluate participant engagement using smile sheets to assess training effectiveness. Then discover how to measure learning and knowledge retention with quizzes and assessments. The third measure of training success is on-the-job behavior, where Ajay explains how to evaluate improvements in real-world performance. Finally, examine how to assess the organizational impact of your program and communicate the results of all four measures with written reports and visual representations of your discovery work.
