[Course_Description]
In this installment of The Power of PreViz, Dane Howard meets with the leaders of One & Co, an industrial design firm that creates products from touch phones to sporting goods and furniture, and asks them to share their insights and expertise in previsualizing, or visually planning, successful design concepts. Discover how they use previsualization techniques to form new ideas, establish a vision for projects, and see them to market. Principal Jonah Becker also shares their process for researching the market, the competition, and other aspects that inform a product's design, and how this information, along with the deliverables from each stage of the design phase, combine to create a compelling story for clients and consumers.
