[Course_Description]
SQL Server database triggers help database developers automate routine tasks. Triggers wait for an activating event to occur, then immediately respond with preprogrammed operations. This course, from database expert Adam Wilbert, takes a deep dive into leveraging these powerful and flexible components of a SQL Server database. Follow along and learn how to create and deploy different types of triggers, and get hands-on experience using triggers to solve common problems, such as timestamping data changes or collecting information about table events. Adam also helps you manage your database triggers: enabling, disabling, and reordering triggers as necessary. Plus, follow along with a hands-on project in chapter six, which uses triggers to perform tasks automatically in an inventory management system, such as updating inventory when new product is received.
