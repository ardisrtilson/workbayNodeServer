Learn the basic rules for achieving a balanced, professional, attractive, and compelling presentation, in Design 101. John McWade covers design essentials in way that won't get you bogged down in the details or feel overwhelmed. This course is perfect for people new to design and nondesigners tasked with putting together a presentationâ€”those who just don't know how to make a design stand out or how to go beyond the templates in PowerPoint or Keynote. John offers expert advice on typography, color, consistency, using images, keeping it simple, and more. Good presentations take time and thought. Design is too important to leave to a computer! Use these techniques to make personalized, thoughtful presentations that both educate and inspire.
