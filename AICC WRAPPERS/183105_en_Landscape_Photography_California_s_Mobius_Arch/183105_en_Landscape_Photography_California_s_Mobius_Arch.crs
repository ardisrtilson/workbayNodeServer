Before you grab your camera and get in your car, stop here first. Keith Kiska's Landscape Photography series is designed to inspire and educate you before you head out on your next adventure. In this installment, Keith details the creative process behind capturing the drama of the Mobius Arch, a natural rock formation in California's Sierra Nevada mountains. He reviews the gear and shooting techniques he uses to capture a panorama, the ever-changing light, and a dramatic nighttime shot. Finally, he'll show how to develop the raw photos with Photoshop and Camera Raw.
