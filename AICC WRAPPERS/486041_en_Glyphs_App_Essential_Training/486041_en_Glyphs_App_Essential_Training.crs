[Course_Description]
Every designer has a typeface in them. The Glyphs app is a friendly yet powerful program that will help unlock that inner visual voice. This course helps you make your own fonts using the Glyphs app, starting with an introduction to the parts of letters (type anatomy) and the parts of a font (the character set). Charles Nix leads a tour of the Glyphs workspace and then coaches you through the construction of a complete fontâ€”from outline to stroke, stroke to character, characters to typeface. There are special sections dedicated to spacing, kerning, optional OpenType features, and font testing and export. Charles also shows how to create type families with multiple masters. The conclusion includes resources for further learning about typography and typeface design.
