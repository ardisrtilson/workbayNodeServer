[Course_Description]
Technology provides businesses with real insight into customer’s thoughts, desires, and behaviors. But this unprecedented access can pose real ethical dilemmas. Can you sell customer data to other companies? Can you charge different customers more for the same product? The answers will define your organization. Yet many of these decisions aren’t happening in the boardroom. Instead they’re made in much smaller meetings with people just like you—project managers, business analysts, directors, and software developers. This course gives you the skills you need to make the right decisions. Instructor Doug Rose helps you consider the duties you have to your customer, think about the consequences of your actions, and maintain high employee morale as you wrestle with these key data ethics challenges. This course was created by Doug Rose. We are please to offer this training in our library.
