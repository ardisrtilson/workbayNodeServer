[Course_Description]
Identity and access management systems help organizations accomplish several fundamental tasks: identifying users, authenticating them, and ensuring that they can access only the resources and information that they are privy to. In this course—the third installment in the CySA+ (CS0-002) Cert Prep series—instructor Mike Chapple delves into the identity access management portion of domain two of the CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) (CS0-002) exam: Software and Systems Security. Mike discusses different means of verifying identity, including biometrics; key authentication techniques, systems, and protocols; authorization and privilege management; the identity management lifecycle; and how to address common security issues in the realm of identity management.
