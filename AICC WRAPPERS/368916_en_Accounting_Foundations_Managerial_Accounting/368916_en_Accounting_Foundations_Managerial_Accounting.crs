[Course_Description]
Managerial accounting helps managers make decisions using an organization's financial data. An understanding of managerial accounting helps you figure out how much a product costs, analyze when your company breaks even, and budget for expenses and future growth. In this course, accounting professors Jim and Kay Stice cover all the fundamentals, including costs and cost behaviors, cost-volume-profit (CVP) relationships, cost flows, standard costing and activity-based costing, and budgeting.
