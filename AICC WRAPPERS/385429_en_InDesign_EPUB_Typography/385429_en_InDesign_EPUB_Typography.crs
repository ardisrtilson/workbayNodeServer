[Course_Description]
Think great EPUB typography is impossible? Think again. Typefaces for screens are multiplying, ereaders are improving, and InDesign CC has more features for customizing EPUBs than ever before. This combination gives designers the freedom and flexibility to build more aesthetically pleasing EPUBs. In this course, Nigel French leads you through the basics of creating EPUBS with good typography in InDesign CC. Learn how to choose fonts for maximum legibility and readability, size and scale type, thread text throughout a layout, and adjust alignment and spacing. Nigel also covers working with special characters, bullets, and paragraph rules. Note: While most of the lessons are centered on reflowable EPUBs, specific issues for fixed-layout EPUBs are called out along the way.
