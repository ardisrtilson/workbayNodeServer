[Course_Description]
There are many reasons for shooting with multiple cameras. Perhaps it's to save time or achieve multiple angles. Or it might be to capture what's happening across a large area, like a sports arena or the stage during a concert. Luckily for editors, Adobe Premiere Pro supports editing and syncing footage from multiple cameras in situations like these. The multi-camera editing process in Premiere is similar to live switching that occurs in mobile studios and newsrooms, and helps speed up the post-processing workflow. In this course, Rich Harrington reviews that workflow, showing you how to ingest footage and align it properly, as well as finish your video with color-correction and color-matching techniques.
