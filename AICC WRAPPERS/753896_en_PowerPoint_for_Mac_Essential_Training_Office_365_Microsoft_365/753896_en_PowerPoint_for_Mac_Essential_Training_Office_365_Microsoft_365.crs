Learn how to create, edit, and share presentations with Microsoft PowerPoint, the powerful presentation and slideshow tool included with Office 365 for Mac. Jess Stratton begins by stepping through how to build a slideshow from scratch, as well as how to leverage PowerPoint templates and themes for quick construction. Jess then demonstrates how to add and edit text, images, charts, video, and animation; format slides for consistency; and add speaker notes and transitions to ensure a smooth delivery. Plus, discover how to collaborate on changes and then share your final presentation as a video file or PDF.
