[Course_Description]
Research indicates that likability can be equally if not more important than competence when hiring managers are making decisions. Likability also helps you succeed once you land the job: Likable employees get more assistance and earn more promotions. In this course, you can learn simple techniques for making yourself a more appealing candidate by shifting behaviors that influence how others perceive you, ultimately becoming more likable to your network and the decision-makers in the hiring process. Dr. Dawn Graham—career director for the Executive MBA Program at the Wharton School and a former recruiter—helps you tap into and enhance your natural likability, build your network, and start off your new role on a positive note.
