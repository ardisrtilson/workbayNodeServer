[Course_Description]
Search engine optimization (SEO) is crucial to the success of every business. But local SEO is particularly important to brick and mortar stores and services. Customers don't rely on the yellow pages anymore. They turn to Google instead. This course will help businesses of all sizes achieve maximum visibility on search engines, and drive more traffic (web traffic and foot traffic!) to their sites and stores. First, get an overview of the local SEO landscape, tips for evaluating and optimizing your site, and advice on conducting keyword research. Author Brad Batesole also shows how to optimize your site structure and on-page content, acquire local citations, and make sure your name, address, and phone (NAP) information is consistent across the web. Want to appear in Google Maps and local search results? Find out how to make sure your listing shows up by setting up your Google My Business page, and learn how to incorporate links and reviews. Finally, discover how to secure backlinks from reputable sources and handle SEO for a business that has multiple locations. If you want to boost your ranking, understand the competition, or just understand how search engines like Google operate at a local level, this is the course for you.
