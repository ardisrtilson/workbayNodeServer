[Course_Description]
Photographing kids can be tricky. Some kids love the camera, but many freeze up as soon as you point one at them. To take great portraits, it helps to meet the kids on their turf and on their terms. That means photographing them in environments where they get to be kids. In this course, we join photographer Erika Thornes in a sun-dappled park for a look at the techniques she employs to shoot her beautiful, natural-light portraits. Watch as Erika engages with a little girl and adjusts her shooting approach based on what the child is doing. Erika also demonstrates tricks for dealing with high-energy kids. The course concludes with a review of the day's shoot and some post-processing tips.
