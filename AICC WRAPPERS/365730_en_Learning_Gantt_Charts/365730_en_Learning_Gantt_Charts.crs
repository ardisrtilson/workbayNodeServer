A Gantt chart is an incredibly helpful way to illustrate the critical deadlines associated with any projectâ€”connecting start and end dates of individual tasks and their interdependencies.

Learn how to create Gantt charts to communicate with customers, plan resources, monitor progress for one or multiple projects, assess risk, predict spend, and decide whether or not you can speed up your project. Chris also discusses the most common problems and provides tips to help you avoid mistakes.
