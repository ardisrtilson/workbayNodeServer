Learn the best ways to work with catalogs in Lightroom Classic CC and make your photo management process as reliable and efficient as possible. This exploration of Lightroom Classic CC kicks off with the essentials: locating, saving, and (most importantly) backing up your catalog. Then author Chris Orwig shows how to clean up and speed up catalogs, access photos on more than one computer, merge multiple catalogs, and export catalog data for use in another program. Last but not least, Chris shows how to back up your catalog periodically, so you don't lose any important changes or photographs down the road.
