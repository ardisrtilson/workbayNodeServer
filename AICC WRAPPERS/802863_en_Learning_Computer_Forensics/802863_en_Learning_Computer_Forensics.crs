[Course_Description]
Computer forensics is used to find legal evidence in computers, mobile devices, or data storage units. Although this course won't teach you everything you need to know to become a digital forensics detective, it does cover all the essentials of this growing (and exciting) technical field. Jungwoo Ryoo reviews the basics: the goals of computer forensics, the types of investigations it's used for, and the different specializations within the field. Then, he shows how to prepare for an investigation; acquire data; make sure data is kept in its original state with software and hardware write blockers; analyze the data; and generate a report. He uses a combination of open-source and commercial software, so you'll be able to uncover the information you need with tools that are in your budget.
