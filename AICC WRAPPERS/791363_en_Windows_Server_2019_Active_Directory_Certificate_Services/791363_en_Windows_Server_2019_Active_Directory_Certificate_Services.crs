[Course_Description]
Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) allows workstations, servers, and applications to establish trust within an Active Directory forest without the cost of third-party certificates like TLS. This course shows how the AD CS role can be used to verify identity, encrypt communication, and establish trust in a Windows Server 2019 environment. Instructor Scott Burrell dissects the anatomy of a certificate and shows how to configure a public key infrastructure (PKI) in your own domain. He covers multiple ways to manually and automatically issue certificates and revoke certificates when they're no longer needed via a certificate revocation list.
