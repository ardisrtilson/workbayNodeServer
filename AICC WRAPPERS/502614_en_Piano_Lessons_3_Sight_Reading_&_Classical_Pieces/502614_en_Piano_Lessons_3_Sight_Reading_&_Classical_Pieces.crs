[Course_Description]
Learn how to play piano and sight-read sheet music, while you learn to perform classics from great composers such as Bach, Satie, and Chopin. Music professor and acclaimed accompanist Hugh Sung has created a comprehensive video library of piano lessons and performances of classic tunes shot from multiple angles. Learn at your own pace and build fluency in reading standard notation. Hugh breaks down classics like Minuet in G Major, Prelude in C Major, Gymnop√©die No. 1, and Moonlight Sonata. These are some of the most beautiful songs ever written, and have been specially arranged by Hugh to maximize your learning and enjoyment. Each song is demonstrated at different tempos, so you can slowly increase your pace as you get more comfortable at the keyboard, and overlaid with notation, so you can read each line of music as it's taught. This training builds on the rest of the Piano Lessons series and is designed for all levels of pianists who want to learn to quickly play the music they love. Note: This course was recorded and produced by ArtistWorks. We are honored to host this training in our library.
