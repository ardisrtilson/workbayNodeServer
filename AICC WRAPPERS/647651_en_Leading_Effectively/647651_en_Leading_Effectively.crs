[Course_Description]
Leaders all face the same challenge: too much to do and not enough time to do it. In this course, leadership consultant Mike Figliuolo introduces the concept of leadership capital, which is the finite amount of time and energy you have available to lead, manage, and develop your team members. He outlines the four ways leaders invest their leadership capital: directing people, making sure the work gets done, making sure the work is delivered, and developing talent. He then helps you assess whether you are using your leadership capital wisely by looking at team results: the quantity of work, the quality of work, timeliness, and impacts on morale and relationships. At the end, he explains how to reallocate your leadership capital and change both your behavior and your team's in order to improve performance.
