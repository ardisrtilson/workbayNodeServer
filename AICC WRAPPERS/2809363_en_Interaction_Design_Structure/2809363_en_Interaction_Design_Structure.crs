[Course_Description]
Before UX designers can move on to anything else, they must think holistically about the structure of their project, determining how every element—no matter how small—fits into the overall experience. In this course, Diane Cronenwett delves into the role of structure in interaction design. Diane explains how the process of defining a project's structure helps designers see the big picture (and organize project elements in a more thoughtful way). She goes over when to use flow diagrams in UX design projects, as well as how to create information architecture deliverables. Plus, learn how to design page-level structure, organize projects with a grid, determine the right interface elements needed put everything together, and more.
