[Course_Description]
5S is far more than a housekeeping initiative. 5S is a method of creating a clean and orderly workplace that exposes waste and makes abnormalities immediately visible. This course explains exactly what 5S is, where it originated, and why it’s about much more than cleaning. It defines the five Ss—Seiri, Seiton, Seisou, Seiketsu, and Shitsuke—and the corresponding five steps of the modern 5S methodology. You can also learn how to create or enhance your own 5S program following this same approach. This course was created by Gemba Academy, a leading provider of lean and Six Sigma training. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
