[Course_Description]
In this Type Project, designer Nigel French provides a historical background on the International Typographic Style, aka the Swiss Style, developed in Switzerland in the 1950s and '60s. He then takes you through a step-by-step process to create a new poster-sized advertisement inspired by a 1955 original from Swiss-Style designer Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockmann. Using Adobe Illustrator's Polar Grid tool and Live Paint Bucket, you'll re-create this clean and classic design while updating the contents for your own event.
