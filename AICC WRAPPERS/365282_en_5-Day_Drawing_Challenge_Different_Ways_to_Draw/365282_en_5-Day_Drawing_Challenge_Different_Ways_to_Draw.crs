[Course_Description]
Drawing is for everyone. It just takes practice! Exercise your drawing skills and become better at seeing and capturing the world around you with Von Glitschka's 5-day drawing challenges. This installment asks you to consider different ways of drawing: from thinking renewably to getting surrealistic. Von will assign a drawing challenge for each day. Take the time you need to finish each challenge, and then watch the video where Von shares his own hand-drawn solution. There are no right answers here; his solutions should serve as inspiration. For more encouragement, check out the chapter on staying inspired, featuring artist Stephanie Smith. And don't forget to share your drawings via Twitter and Facebook! Use the hashtag #5daydraw.
