[Course_Description]
Take your surface design presentations from flat to fabulous by creating seamless pattern fills that appear to drape around the body. Robin Schneider guides you in using warp, displace, Liquify, and layer blend modes to add drape, wrinkles, ruffles, and shading to pattern fills, giving your illustrations a more realistic look. Plus, learn to do it all with Smart Objects, so you can easily swap out one pattern for a new pattern that retains the warping and shading of the original.
