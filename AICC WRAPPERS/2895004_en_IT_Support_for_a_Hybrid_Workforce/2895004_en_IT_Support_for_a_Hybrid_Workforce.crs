[Course_Description]
Around the world, offices are preparing for reopening. After months of supporting a primarily remote workforce, IT teams now need to understand how to best support teams in a hybrid environment. Hybrid workforces come with their own concerns regarding security, communications, hardware and software, and device management. This course focuses on these key elements and others that IT teams should consider before their return. Instructor Robert McMillen explains how to develop a plan that allows for successfully supporting a hybrid workforce, how to implement security, how to remotely troubleshoot hardware issues, how to select the best software for remote collaboration and communication, and how to manage devices that travel to and from the office.
