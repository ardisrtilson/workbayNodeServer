[Course_Description]
If you’re looking to get up and running with BRF+ quickly, hands-on experience—in programming or any other skill—is a great way to learn. This course shows you how to create a BRF+ deliverable, covering everything from the requisite jargon and project preparation, to creating formulas, decision tables, functions, and rulesets. Throughout the course, the integration between ABAP code and BRF+ is detailed, providing you with a clearer understanding of how this tool can be applied. Completing the project in this hands-on course will help you learn how to translate business rules into visual documentation, discover how to maintain documentation within BRF+, and increase your confidence in doing more complex BRF+ projects going forward.
