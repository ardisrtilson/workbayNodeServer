Amazon Web Services (AWS) Well-Architected Framework helps enterprise architects build more secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient cloud-based infrastructure for their applications. Amazon created the Framework to promote AWS best practices and help architects and engineers get up and running more quickly. This course serves as a high-level introduction, providing a general overview of the Framework, its benefits, and its five pillars: operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization. Instructor Mark Wilkins also provides demos of the main Framework tools, including the Well-Architected Tool, Well-Architected Labs, and other resources.
