With the advent of the big data era, organizations are swamped with information, and the sheer volume is changing the dynamics of business. Finding insights in the mountains of data—and keeping that data secure—are key factors driving business success today, especially for fields such as healthcare, ecommerce, and IT. Information governance (IG) helps organizations minimize information risks and costs while maximizing its value. IG is about security, control, and optimization of information. Learn the basic tenets of the emerging field of IG, beginning with definitions and concepts. Robert Smallwood explains the basics of IG and identifies key areas where an IG program will make a difference. He shares proven strategies, methods, and best practices for ensuring the ongoing success of your IG program.
