[Course_Description]
Adobe Lightroom has a lot of great photo-management features, but that's no guarantee that your catalog will be well organized. That's up to you. In this course, photographer, author, and educator Tim Grey tackles the most common problems that Lightroom Classic CC users encounter (or introduce themselves), including missing photos, photos scattered across multiple catalogs, confusingly named folders, keyword spelling errors, and much more.
