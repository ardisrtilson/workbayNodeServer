[Course_Description]
Producing great motion graphics requires a great toolset. Blackmagic Design Fusion provides a rich, full-featured compositing environment to bring together video footage, 3D animation, and graphics, text, and photos in a fully three-dimensional space. And best of all, the non-Studio version is completely free. In this course, Adam Crespi shows how to create an identity bumper in Studio 8 by compositing and animating a variety of assets. Starting with the raw elements, he assembles a composition and animates a camera in the scene. From there, he adds lights, particles, a painted logo, and post effects, and then renders the final bumper. Each step of the process is rich with object lessons that are applicable to the variations that a compositor will face in the real world.
