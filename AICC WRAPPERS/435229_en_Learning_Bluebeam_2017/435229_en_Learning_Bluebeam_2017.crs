[Course_Description]
Bluebeam Revu has changed modern construction documentation. A revolutionary PDF program, Bluebeam can convert 2D and 3D drawings from almost any CAD or BIM software into PDFs that the entire project team can view. Bluebeam also offers markup, estimation, redlining, and project management tools for managing each step in a document's lifecycle. Plus, you can search for more than just text; with Bluebeam you can find symbols, details, and callouts throughout a set of documents. This training course will teach you how to use all these tools and leverage the built-in cloud collaboration features in Bluebeam to manage your construction projects in a paperless environment. Jim Rogers helps you choose the right version of Bluebeam for your company, customize the tools and views, convert files into PDFs, and create PDFs from scratch. In the final chapters, he covers Bluebeam Studio, the cloud components that make it easy to take projects mobile and global.
