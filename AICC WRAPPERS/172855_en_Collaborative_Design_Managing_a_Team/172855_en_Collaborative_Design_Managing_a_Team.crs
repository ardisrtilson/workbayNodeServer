[Course_Description]
Effective collaboration can make or break a project, as anyone who's ever suffered through design by committee can attest. But how do you manage a team—often including many external clients and internal creatives—so that collaboration moves smoothly and nets great results? This kind of teamwork requires clear roles and responsibilities, well-defined parameters, opportunities for input, people-management skills, and more. In this course, veteran web entrepreneur Lauren Bacon provides a proven framework for bringing people together collaboratively to create extraordinary outcomes.
