[Course_Description]
Many creative teams consider design by committee one of their greatest fears. But creative collaboration doesn't need to be inefficient or banalâ€”in fact, it can produce outstanding results. However, the process needs to be well coordinated in order to avoid consensus paralysis, scope creep, or death by compromise. In this course, Lauren Bacon shares her hard-earned lessons about coordinating teams both large and small to yield projects that soar.
