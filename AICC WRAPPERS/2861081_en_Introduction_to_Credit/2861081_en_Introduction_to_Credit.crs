[Course_Description]
Your credit score might just look like a number—but it’s a number that defines you. Your score is checked when you make major purchases, apply for loans, and even sometimes when you start a new job. In this course, you can learn how to pull yourself out of bad credit, how to get started if you have no credit, and how to keep your credit score high. You can explore the types of credit as well as the seven factors affecting your score—in both a positive and negative direction. Remember: Good credit is a marathon, not a sprint. The sooner you start, the sooner you’ll be able to take advantage of all the opportunities that good credit has to offer. This course was created by WealthFit.
