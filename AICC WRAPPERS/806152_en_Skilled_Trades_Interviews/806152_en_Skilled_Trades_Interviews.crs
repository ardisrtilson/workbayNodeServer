Join Allen Blue—vice president of product management and co-founder of LinkedIn—as he introduces you to a series of interviews with professionals in the skilled trades. LinkedIn and the Economic Graph are working to create opportunities for everyone in the workforce, and with this weekly series, they’re providing curious job seekers with an insider look at what a career in the trades actually looks like. Explore the different career paths available, as well as what it takes to land a job in your trade of choice. Each interviewee shares how they broke into their field, as well as their unique perspective on the challenges and rewards of their chosen profession. Tune in every Monday to learn how apprenticeship and other on-the-job training programs work, what a typical day looks like for different types of skilled workers, and more.
