Great management is a delicate balance. Youâ€™re responsible for setting and achieving certain goals, but the ways of getting there are as unpredictable as humans themselves. Your job is to create a structure within which your team members can collaborate, create, and stay collectively on track as you work together to build a whole greater than the sum of its parts. This involves careful planning, deliberate dialogue, honest self-assessment, and many other practices. In this course, get project management advice from real-world practitioners, including actor and director Stanley Tucci and Chief Rob Roy, an award-winning veteran of the US Navy.
