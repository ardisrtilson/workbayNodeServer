[Course_Description]
Diplomacy is a mindset; tact is a strategy. In this course, communications professor Tatiana Kolovou helps you realize the benefits of communicating with tact and diplomacy in workplace situations. She walks you through four scenarios that you might encounter on an average day, and coaches you through appropriate responses to challenging situations at work. She emphasizes core skills, such as authenticity, empathy, and listening, and shows examples, stories, and facts that bring their importance to life. By taking opportunities to practice at work and in your personal life, you can strengthen this delicate balance of skills and build relationships that can survive difficult interactions.
