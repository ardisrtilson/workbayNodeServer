[Course_Description]
Being overwhelmed isn’t having too much to do; it’s not knowing where to start. Learn how to get more done without feeling overcome. In this course, adapted from the popular podcast How to Be Awesome at Your Job, host Pete Mockaitis interviews CEO Tanya Dalton. Tanya provides her take on being more productive daily, which involves figuring out and focusing on your own passions instead of other people’s fires. She identifies where overwhelm truly comes from and explains how to craft the three components of your personal North Star. Plus, learn the benefits of a biweekly brain dump to get a bird’s eye view of your task list and focus on the things that matter most. This course was created by Pete Mockaitis of How to Be Awesome at Your Job. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
