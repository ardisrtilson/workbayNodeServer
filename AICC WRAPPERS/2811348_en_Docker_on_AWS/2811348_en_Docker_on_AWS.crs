[Course_Description]
Docker is the next step beyond virtualization. When deployed with Amazon Elastic Container Service (AWS ECS), you have a solid foundation for monitoring and managing Docker containers, including starting containers and scheduling tasks. This frees up developers to concentrate on your container-based applicationsâ€”instead of your hosting platform. In this course, Robert Starmer demonstrates how to use Docker and the powerful features in AWS to build and manage container-based applications. Learn how to create containerized applications, set up AWS ECS, mange container scale and network models, troubleshoot issues, and more.
