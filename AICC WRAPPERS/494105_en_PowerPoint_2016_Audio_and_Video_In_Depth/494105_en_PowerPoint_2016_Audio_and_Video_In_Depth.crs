Make your PowerPoint presentations more engaging by incorporating audio and video effectively. In this course, Garrick Chow shows how to work with video and audio clips from a variety of sources, including YouTube and your own computer. He then moves on to the finer points of audio and video editingâ€”directly in PowerPoint.

Plus, discover how to optimize the compatibility and file size of multimedia presentations so that they can be played on a wide range of computers and devices.
