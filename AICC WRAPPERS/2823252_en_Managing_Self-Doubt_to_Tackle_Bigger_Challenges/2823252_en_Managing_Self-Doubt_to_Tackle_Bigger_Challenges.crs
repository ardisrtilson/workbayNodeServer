[Course_Description]
The safety instinct is the key driver behind fear and self-doubt. It keeps us away from dangers and threats—but also away from opportunities for growth and development. In this course, adapted from the popular podcast How to Be Awesome at Your Job, host Pete Mockaitis interviews author Tara Mohr (Playing Big), an expert on leadership and well-being. Tara provides deep insight into how the safety instinct plays into our fears and self-doubt—and how we can optimally respond. Pete and Tara talk about emotional risk, comfort zones, and the narratives that keep us from going after what we really want. Learn how to combat the worst-case scenario you create in your head and channel your fear into excitement. Plus, discover the best antidote to the inner critic: the inner mentor.
