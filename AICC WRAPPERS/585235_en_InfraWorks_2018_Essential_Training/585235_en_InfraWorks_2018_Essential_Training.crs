[Course_Description]
Learn to create new worlds inside InfraWorks, the design and engineering program that gives your infrastructure and urban planning projects 3D real-world context. In this course, Josh Modglin helps you get up to speed with all the essential features of InfraWorks. He discusses how InfraWorks differs from Autodesk AutoCAD Civil 3D, familiarizes you with the InfraWorks interface, and shows how to add style and details—such as trees, roads, and buildings—to your world. He also helps you analyze and visualize your design, and dives into the subject of interoperability between InfraWorks and AutoCAD Civil 3D.
