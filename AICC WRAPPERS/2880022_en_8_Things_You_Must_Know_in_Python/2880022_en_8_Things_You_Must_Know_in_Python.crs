[Course_Description]
There are many beginner Python tutorials, but to build useful applications, you need to move beyond the basics. This course helps you on the journey to writing intermediate-level Python code. Instructor Jonathan Fernandes presents eight things that you should know how to do in Python. Topics include the Python any() and all() methods, using enumerate() and zip() methods, min() and max(), and more. For each topic, Jonathan provides a hands-on approach and then gives you a challenge (with solutions) to practice. Note: This course was created by Jonathan Fernandes. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
