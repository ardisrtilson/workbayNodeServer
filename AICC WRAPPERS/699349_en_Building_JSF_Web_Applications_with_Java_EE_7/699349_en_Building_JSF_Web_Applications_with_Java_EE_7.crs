Learn how to build web apps using JavaServer Faces (JSF) with Java Enterprise Edition (EE). JSF is the standard for building server-side user interfaces. Follow along in this course to build a basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) application, starting with creating classes, configuring front-end components, and performing CRUD operations. Messages, event handling, and form validation are also covered. The course concludes by going through session management and authentication.
