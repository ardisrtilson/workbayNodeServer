Microsoft 365 is a bundled suite of SaaS applications and services that businesses can subscribe to. A more robust offering than the similarly named Office 365, Microsoft 365 offers Windows 10, Office 365, and Enterprise Mobility + Security, all packaged together. Once configured properly, this portfolio of products can enhance an enterprise's security and productivity and help them meet their compliance requirements. In this course, Andrew Bettany provides a thorough guide to all of the features, capabilities, and opportunities within Microsoft 365. He clearly unpacks each major topic and technology and offers demonstrations for key scenarios. Upon wrapping up this course, you'll grasp how to administrate Microsoft 365, as well as how the technology within the suite fits together.
