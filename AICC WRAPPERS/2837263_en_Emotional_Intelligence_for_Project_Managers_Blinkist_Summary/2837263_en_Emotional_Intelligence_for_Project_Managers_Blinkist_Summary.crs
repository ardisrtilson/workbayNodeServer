Emotional Intelligence for Project Managers builds on the writings of Daniel Goleman, who developed principles of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is crucial in many aspects of life, and author Anthony Mersino tailors Goleman’s principles specifically to the needs of project managers. Discover how to develop skills such as self-awareness, self-management, and social awareness, and practice relationship management and team leadership on an advanced level. This short, audio-only course helps project managers master the people skills they need to achieve outstanding results—in under 15 minutes. Note: This audiobook summary was produced by Blinkist.
