[Course_Description]
CompTIA recognizes that cloud-based infrastructure services is an increasingly important piece of an organization’s IT systems. The CompTIA Cloud+ certification validates that you have the skills necessary to plan, implement, maintain, and deliver cloud technologies and infrastructure—it's a credential that can boost your career and your visibility to employers. This course helps you prepare for the first domain of the exam, Cloud Concepts and Models. Learn about the different types of clouds and the basics of a robust cloud architecture. Then review the system requirements for cloud deployments, and discover how to successfully create and execute a cloud deployment plan. Instructor Tom Carpenter also explains how to test your deployment and resolve common issues. This Total Seminars course covers the exam certification topics.
