[Course_Description]
Today’s leaders need an agile way to improve their brand and stay relevant on a regular basis. The world is changing fast and it’s not always practical to do a giant, expensive, one-time rebrand that’s outdated as soon as it’s complete. In this course, Wes Kao teaches startup-inspired frameworks and strategies for companies of all sizes to do rebranding in easy, repeatable, and iterative steps. Discover how to prioritize to move fast, identify your rebranding goals with more precision, and translate your vision into public-facing copy and visuals. Rebranding your business on the go can be a stressful process, but with Wes’ guidance, you’ll be able to identify your rebranding goals, avoid common pitfalls, and take action with confidence.
