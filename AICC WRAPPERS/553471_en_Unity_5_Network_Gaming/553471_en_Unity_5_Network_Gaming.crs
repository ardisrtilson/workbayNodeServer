Adding a multiplayer component can enhance a game's overall playabilityâ€”not to mention its staying power in the marketplace. In this course, boost your network development skills and discover how to use Unity 5 to add multiplayer network components to your games. Bruce Van Horn starts by covering a little network game theory, and then dives into the creation of a multiplayer tank combat game. Learn how to adapt this classic game concept into a network-playable LAN game that can be played over the Internet. Along the way, learn about setting up the Network Manager, adding health indicators, fragging the enemy, and more.
