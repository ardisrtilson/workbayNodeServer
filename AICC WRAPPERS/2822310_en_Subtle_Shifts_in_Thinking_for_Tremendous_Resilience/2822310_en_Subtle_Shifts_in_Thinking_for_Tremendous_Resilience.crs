[Course_Description]
Negative thought patterns can be self-fulfilling. How we react to external events is often determined by our internal mindset. Feeling empowered and satisfied requires us to shift our thinking. In this course, adapted from the popular podcast How to Be Awesome at Your Job, host Pete Mockaitis interviews renowned author and speaker Charlie Harary. Charlie provides advice to adjust your recurring thought patterns to find your greatness, enhance emotional wellbeing, and enjoy work more every day. Follow along with their conversation, and come away with tips on how to react to the world in a more empowered way, identify the innate needs you must fulfill to be satisfied, and take a proactive approach to learning and growth. This course was created by Pete Mockaitis of How to Be Awesome at Your Job. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
