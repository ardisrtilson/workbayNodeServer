[Course_Description]
Product design sketches should be technically accurate as well as aesthetically pleasingâ€”even when it's a part as complicated as a Formula 1 steering wheel. Veejay Gahir shows you how to render a design in SketchBook Pro using this complex example: from importing reference images and the initial outline to adding shading, highlights, and feature lines with tools like Flood Fill, Lock Transparency, and various brushes. Veejay also walks you through how to add text to your design and export the final work as a JPEG file.
