[Course_Description]
Designers aren't the only ones who use InDesign. Editors, copywriters, and admin staff often have to edit text right inside InDesign. This course speaks directly to the needs of writers and editors who have to use InDesign for the first timeâ€”or want to use it more regularly and efficiently. Author and designer Nigel French explains how to set up an editorial workspace that puts the tools you need most at close reach. He then moves on to selecting and editing text in InDesign: changing case, adding special characters, formatting lists, and inserting breaks. He also shows how to use the Story Editor, Notes, and the Track Changes feature, and explains how InDesign documents are constructed, so that you can edit them with more confidence.
