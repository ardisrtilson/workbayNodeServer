[Course_Description]
Scott Onstott has been using AutoCAD for 24 years and has witnessed its evolution into the world-leading application for computer-aided drafting and design. You too can harness its power and start creating detailed CAD drawings, whatever your field: design, architecture, or engineering. In this in-depth course, Scott shows you how to draw precise, measured 2D drawingsâ€”the basis of design communication the world over. Then he shows how to create and modify geometry, layers, blocks, attributes, dimensions, and layouts, and finally, how to start sharing your drawings with others.
