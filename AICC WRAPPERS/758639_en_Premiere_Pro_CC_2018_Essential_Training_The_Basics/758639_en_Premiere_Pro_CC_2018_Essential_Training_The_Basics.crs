[Course_Description]
Get up and running with Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2018. This course helps beginners unlock the potential of this powerful video-editing program. Instructor and filmmaker Ashley Kennedy steps through all the fundamentals: editing video and audio, correcting color, adding titles and effects, and more. Her project-based approach lends context to each of the tools, allowing you to experience both the technical and creative sides of the editing process. She begins with a tour of the Premiere Pro interface, and then goes through the entire post-production workflowâ€”including media import and organization, editing and trimming, audio adjustment, applying and modifying effects, color correction, titles, and output. By the end of the course, you should be able to hit the ground running and create your own professional video projects with Premiere Pro.
