[Course_Description]
Discover new imaging superpowers by mastering the tools in Adobe Camera Rawâ€”the engine at the heart of all Adobe photo editing software. Learn how to access Camera Raw from Photoshop, Lightroom, and After Effects; apply custom tone curves; and leverage the HSL and grayscale controls to precisely adjust the color of an image. Find out to apply automated adjustments with presets, profiles, LUTs, and snapshots, and use advanced controls such as cloning and masks to limit your adjustments. Instructor Rich Harrington closes the course with some creative techniques for merging high dynamic range images and panoramas, and tips for adjusting workflow options and converting raw files to other formats.
