[Course_Description]
Retouching faces used to be challenging without using Adobe Photoshop, but recent improvements in Lightroom—involving the Spot Removal tool, Clone Stamp tool, Adjustment Brush tool, syncing capabilities, and more—have made it much simpler to use Lightroom as a stand-alone solution. This course shows you how to save time by staying in Lightroom instead of Photoshop. Discover how to remove unwanted blemishes, make local or targeted adjustments, enhance eyes, smooth skin, and more.
