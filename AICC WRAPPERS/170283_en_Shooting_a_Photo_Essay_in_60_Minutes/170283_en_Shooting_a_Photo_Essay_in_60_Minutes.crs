[Course_Description]
Oftentimes when you're traveling, you stumble upon a gem of a place or a person who deserves to have a story told. But you can't spend a week or even a day shooting them. You're on the road. You've got an hour to take shots that convey something of the story, and then it's back behind the wheel. Or back on to the cruise ship. Or back to your family. In this course, photojournalist Paul Taggart rises to the challenge and shoots a photo essay in only an hour. Shooting under time pressure is a common challenge for a photojournalist, and Paul describes the kinds of planning and shooting that gets results. Learn what kinds of shots you'll need for any type of photo essay, and learn how to engage and interact with subjects who you just met and might never see again.
