[Course_Description]
Outsourcing presents challenges that arenâ€™t part of a traditional working environment. Instructor Bob McGannon gives you guidance and information on how to work effectively in this growing industry. Bob explains the advantages and disadvantages of different outsourcing models and the different business drivers that lead companies to consider outsourcing. He discusses common elements of the outsourcing contract, then covers service levels and service requests. Accurate performance reporting is essential for any outsourcing arrangement, and Bob steps through how to ensure relevant, accurate information is provided for business operations. Since most contracts need updating over time, he identifies the steps required to successfully apply changes to an outsourcing contract. Bob concludes by offering other resources that you can use to further your knowledge about outsourcing arrangements. Note: This course was created by Bob McGannon.
