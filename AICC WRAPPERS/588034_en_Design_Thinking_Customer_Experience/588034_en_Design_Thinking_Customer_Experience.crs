[Course_Description]
Customer expectations are higher than ever before, and business success is becoming more and more dependent on a company's ability to meet or exceed those expectations with nearly every interaction. Customer experience—or CX—is the summary of all the interactions a company has with a customer over time. While understanding how to consider and choreograph those interactions is undeniably complex, at its core, customer experience is about something quite simple: relationships. In this course, frog's director of strategy, Geoffrey Schwartz, introduces you to customer experience and why it's important in today's hypercompetitive world. Geoffrey breaks down the different components that make up a customer experience, like archetypes, activities, interactions, and experience principles. Throughout the course, he uses real-world examples to demonstrate how those components come together to form a company's relationship with their customers. At the end of the course, you'll have the foundational tools needed to take a holistic view of an organization's customer experience and identify opportunities that can deepen relationships and drive loyalty.
