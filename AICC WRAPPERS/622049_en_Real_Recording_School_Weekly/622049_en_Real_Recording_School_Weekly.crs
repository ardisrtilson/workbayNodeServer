[Course_Description]
Welcome to the Real Recording School Weekly series. Every week, Larry Crane leads a class of like-minded audio enthusiasts, engineers, and producers through a new recording or mixing challenge. Learn how to recognize and fix persistent sound issues like clicky bass, snare drum ring, boomy guitars, and hi-hat bleed, so that the music is all that listeners hear. The course features software and plugins, such as iZotope and Pro Tools, but almost all the techniques can be recreated in your favorite DAW. All you need to follow along is a pair of headphones and a passion for sound. Note: Because this is an ongoing series, viewers will not receive a certificate of completion.
