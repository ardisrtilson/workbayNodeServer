Certified nursing assistants (CNAs) play a critical role in helping nursing homes and hospitals function effectively and efficiently. These health professionals provide patients with holistic, day-to-day care, and often serve as the voice of vulnerable patients when they are unable to communicate for themselves. In this course, learn about the role, and the critical responsibilities that CNAs take on, to help you determine if this job is right for you. Explore the range and type of care that CNAs can provide, and review the steps you must take to become a CNA. Discover what a typical CNA's workday looks like, as well as how you can implement professionalism as you carry out your duties. Plus, learn about the impact you can have on patients and their families as a CNAâ€”and why that's important.
