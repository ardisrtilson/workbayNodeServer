Explore the shooting modes that go beyond auto; find out how to take bracketed photos and videos; and learn to adjust camera settings, like ISO, for specific situations, such as mixed lighting, fast movement, and low lighting levels. If you understand your gear, you can get consistently better photos, so keep your camera close by, as Rich explores its many features and controls. Want to get up and running even faster?
