[Course_Description]
Scores of capable, bright, and intellectually curious women end up abandoning the corporate world before they attain positions of power. The obstacles they face along the way—such as systemic sexism, long hours, and conflicting family priorities—often influence their decision to bow out early. Author, speaker, and consultant Joan Kuhl has spent much of her career researching these obstacles and advocating for corporate inclusivity. In this course, Joan lays out the key barriers that hold women back in their careers, as well as the steps they can take to overcome these obstacles and become more courageous leaders. Learn about the importance of mentorship in building your career, the myth of the good girl (and how it can negatively impact your career), how to navigate conflict and deal with difficult personalities, and more.
