[Course_Description]
The Green Belts or Black Belts that lead Lean Six Sigma projects are well-trained and ready to guide your project to the finish line. But what do you, as a team member on a Lean Six Sigma project team, need to know to be effective? In this course, Dr. Richard Chua provides coverage of fundamental Lean Six Sigma tools that can help you add value to your project. Here, he focuses on the Analyze, Improve, and Control phases of the DMAIC—Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control—approach. Discover how Lean Six Sigma integrates lean into DMAIC. Then learn how to conduct analysis using tools like cause-effect diagrams, multi-voting, scatter plots, correlation, and regression. Discover how to improve processes using methodologies such as FMEA and Kaizen. Finally, find out how to implement controls and value-stream management practices. For information about the first two phases of DMAIC, make sure to check out the previous installment of the Lean Six Sigma Teams series.
