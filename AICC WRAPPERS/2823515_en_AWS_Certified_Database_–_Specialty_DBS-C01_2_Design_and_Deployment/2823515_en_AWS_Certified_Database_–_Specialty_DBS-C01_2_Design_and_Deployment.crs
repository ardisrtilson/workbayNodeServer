All quality databases begin with a thoughtful design. In this installment of the AWS Certified Database – Specialty (DBS-C01) series, learn how to design and deploy AWS database solutions as you study for exam DBS-C01. Instructor Tom Carpenter covers database design tools and explains how to design a database for performance, scalability, and compliance. Tom then goes over the backup processes and options related to Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) and instance-based database solutions in AWS, as well as the high-availability options in AWS. Plus, he steps through the process of creating RDS, DynamoDB, Redshift, and instance-based databases. This Total Seminars course covers the exam certification topics.
