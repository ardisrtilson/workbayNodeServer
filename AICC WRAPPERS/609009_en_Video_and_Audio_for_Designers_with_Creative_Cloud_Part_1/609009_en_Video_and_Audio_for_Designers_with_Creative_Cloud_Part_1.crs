[Course_Description]
Increasingly, designers are being asked to get involved in video projects. In this course, Tony Harmer goes over the nuts and bolts of video and audio production with Creative Cloudâ€”specifically for professional designers who are unfamiliar with how to work with those mediums. Most visual designers have some basic skills that translate to working with video and sound. Here, Tony speaks their language, translating potentially foreign terms and concepts into ones that designers may find more familiar. He shows how to leverage preexisting knowledge of Photoshop and Illustrator to grasp the fundamentals of working with motion. Throughout the course, he covers how to use After Effects, Premiere, Media Encoder, and Audition. To wrap up, Tony walks through how to put video and audio together in one piece.
