[Course_Description]
Event Grid is the glue that connects services in Azure. Nearly every Azure service has the ability to publish events for subscriptionâ€”which makes it ideal for decoupled and highly scalable architecture. This course is broken into two basic sections: publishing events from various sources and consuming those events from within Azure. Instructor Robby Millsap shows how to emit events, including custom events; debug and run Event Grid locally; and consume events within Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and Doc Factory. Plus, learn how to leverage advanced features, such as persistent messaging.
