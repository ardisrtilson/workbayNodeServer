[Course_Description]
TAIT was founded in 1978 by Michael Tait as a lighting business. Since its inception, TAIT has evolved into an industry vanguard focused on creating the kind of immersive experiences that inspire wonder, and make onlookers rush to grab their phones to film the spectacle. TAIT has been the creative and technical force behind an array of innovative live-event equipment, from a kinetic sculpture commissioned by Mr. Chow that amazes the diners at his Las Vegas restaurant, to a propeller runway project that allowed Taylor Swift to spin over the crowds at her concerts. In this documentary, learn about the people and processes that help to bring these experiences to life. Discover how different segments of the company—business development, project management, design and engineering, fabrication, and integration—come together to transform early creative conceptions from artists, architects, and show designers into a final product that dazzles on opening night.
