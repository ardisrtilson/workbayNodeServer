[Course_Description]
The handmade aesthetic isn't limited to little boutiques; even large businesses (including Starbucks, Nordstrom, and Whole Foods) understand when it's best to play the handmade card. Kick back in the LogoLounge and learn how imperfection, texture, and personality can help add a sense of authenticity to your client's brand. Design expert Bill Gardner shows how to decide when a human touch is appropriate, incorporate free-form and line-drawing illustration techniques, use color and texture to make surfaces seem more tactile, and use typography to express specific ideas. The good news? You don't have to relinquish your favorite digital tools. Bill shows how to create this old world look using new world shortcuts.
