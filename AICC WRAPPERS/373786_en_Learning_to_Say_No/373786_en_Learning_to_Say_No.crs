[Course_Description]
Learning to say no is about making choices about what is important to you. In this course, Dr. Todd Dewett helps you classify work into categories of importance and decide how it matches your own goals and values. Using these guidelines, you can choose what to say yes to and what to say no to more effectively. In addition, Dr. Dewett also provides advice on how to say no in a way that is brief, honest, positive, and respectful.
