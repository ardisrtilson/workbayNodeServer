[Course_Description]
Filmmakers often need to be able to design and set up lighting for small shoots themselves. While natural light might seem sufficient—and tantalizingly easy—it's rarely coming from the right direction. With some simple video lighting basics, you can dramatically improve the look of your projects. This course aims to help anyone shooting video identify the right equipment and the right techniques for lighting productions of all kinds. Mark W. Gray demonstrates the lights, stands, and cables that are essential for video lighting. He'll talk about a basic hot lighting package like the ARRI Softbank Kit, florescent and LED lighting options, how to properly handle a c-stand, what the heck a stinger is, how to shape light with flags, and other important basic techniques for controlling light on your next video project. NOTE: These techniques are brand-agnostic. If you don't have the lights Mark recommends, you can still get great results!
