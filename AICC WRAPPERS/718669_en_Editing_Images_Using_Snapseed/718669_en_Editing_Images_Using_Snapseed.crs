[Course_Description]
When everyone has a smartphone, anyone can be a photographer. The hard part is editing photos to make them into something truly special. Snapseed is a free app that makes it easy to take and edit professional photos with your iOS or Android device. In this course, pro photographer Justin Reznick shows how Snapseed is used as an integral part of the mobile photography workflow. The first section discusses the Snapseed interface. Next is general editing with some of the commonly used tools: Curves, White Balance, Crop, and more. Justin then moves onto the advanced Snapseed tools, such as tonal contrast and perspective and expert tools such as selections and layers. The course wraps up with some tips for editing different types of photos—landscape, architecture, portrait, and black and white—from start to finish in Snapseed.
