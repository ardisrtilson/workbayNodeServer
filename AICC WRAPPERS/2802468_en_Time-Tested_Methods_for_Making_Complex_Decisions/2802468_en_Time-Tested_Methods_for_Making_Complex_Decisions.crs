[Course_Description]
Decision-making is difficult in an uncertain world. When faced with complex problems, we have three powerful tools at our disposal: intuition, logic, and data. But as each tool on its own is flawed, the trick is knowing how to use them together. By asking the right questions, checking your own biases, designing a method of information-gathering to test your hypotheses, and using probabilistic reasoning to choose the best among several good options, you can make difficult decisions much easier. This course provides the tools and techniques you need to improve your decision-making skills over time and to support your teamâ€™s ability to make high-risk group decisions. Learn how to identify common cognitive blind-spots, develop cogent hypotheses, remain open to a wide range of possible solutions, and choose wisely among them.
