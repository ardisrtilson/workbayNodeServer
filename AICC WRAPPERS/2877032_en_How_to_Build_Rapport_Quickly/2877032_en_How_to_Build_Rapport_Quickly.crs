[Course_Description]
With the rise of technology, people are having fewer face-to-face conversations. As a result, there are fewer opportunities to practice and build our social skills. But with numerous studies showing that having fewer social relationships negatively affects our health, relationship building isn't a skill we can afford to lose. In this course, adapted from the podcast How to Be Awesome at Your Job, best-selling author and customer service consultant John DiJulius shares expert tips for quickly building lasting emotional ties. John outlines the five essential characteristics of relationship building, emphasizing the role that authenticity, curiosity, and empathy play in forging genuine connections. He shares topics you can turn to quickly build rapport and find common ground. Plus, he goes over how to take cues from investigative reporters to ask questions that spark a lively discussion. This course was created by Pete Mockaitis of How to Be Awesome at Your Job. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
