[Course_Description]
There is no way to win without appreciating your team members’ unique strengths. Forgetting that teams are made of individuals with contrasting temperaments, talents, and skills is a surefire way to hire an unbalanced and ineffective workforce—and undercut the potential of your existing staff. Building a successful team is about balancing people’s tendencies toward autonomy and social connection. Doing so successfully allows for creative tension, unlocks motivation, and promotes “flow states” in which teams adapt creatively to new challenges. In this course, leadership experts such as Richard Branson and Joel Peterson explain the best ways to build a winning team. Learn how to capitalize on qualities employees value the most—trust, freedom, and play—in order to build a high-performing and innovative organization. This course includes videos from: Richard Branson, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and founder of the Virgin Group Jim Collins, bestselling author (Good to Great and Built to Last) Joel Peterson, chairman of JetBlue Airways Steven Kotler, journalist, author, and director of research for the Flow Genome Project Jane McGonigal, researcher at the Institute for the Future and author (Reality Is Broken) Note: This course was produced by Big Think.
