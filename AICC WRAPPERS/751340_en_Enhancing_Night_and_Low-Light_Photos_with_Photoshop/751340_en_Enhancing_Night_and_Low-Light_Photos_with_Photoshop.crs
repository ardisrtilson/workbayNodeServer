[Course_Description]
Today's cameras do a great job with low-light and night scenes, but there's always room for improvement—from noise reduction and tonal adjustment, to advanced techniques, such as combining difference exposures. In this course, photographer and educator Sean Duggan explores a range of Camera Raw and Photoshop post-processing techniques aimed at expanding your creative options for night and low-light photography. He begins in Camera Raw for general enhancements and then turns to Photoshop to capitalize on its Merge to HDR feature, which can create high-dynamic-range images for capturing a wide contrast range common in some night scenes. Finally, he includes techniques specifically for photography of the night sky, including how to use luminosity masks on photos of the Milky Way.
