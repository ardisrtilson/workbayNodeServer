[Course_Description]
Is your business making enough money? Are customers buying what you're selling? The hard truth of business is that having the best product or service won't get you sales. Because if you don't make the right offer, it's hard to encourage action. Customers buy your offer, not just simply your product or service. This powerful course teaches you exactly how to put together a proposal that sellsâ€”even if you've never created one before. Learn how to identify your offer's specific value proposition; describe it with great copy; anticipate and overcome customer objections; add value; and create a sense of urgency and scarcity. Plus, discover bonus techniques to craft an irresistible offer using discounts, guarantees, partnerships, and more. This course was created by WealthFit. We are pleased to host this content in our library.
