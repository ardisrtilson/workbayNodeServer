[Course_Description]
Landscape and fine art photographer Seán Duggan has long been drawn to Iceland's primal landscape, where great light, ice, and mountains meet. While he loves taking photographs that stand on their own, he also keeps an eye out for shots he can combine into imaginary landscapes, driven by story and metaphor. In this short documentary, we follow Seán from shooting the ice flows and volcanoes of the Icelandic wilderness to compositing into his images into a new creation, Fire and Ice, using Photoshop. Follow along with the entire process—start to finish—only on lynda.com.
