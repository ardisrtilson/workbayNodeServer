Create great vector graphics with Inkscape, the open-source illustration software. In this course, Mike Rankin, a design professional for over 25 years, covers everything from creating new documents to outputting files for print and the web. Follow along to learn how to work with vector paths; draw shapes; add colors, patterns, and gradients to drawings; transform objects by scaling, rotating, and skewing; and creating special effects with the software's nondestructive filters. You don't need any prior experience with Illustrator or other drawing apps to get the most out of this course. Just download Inkscape and start following along.
