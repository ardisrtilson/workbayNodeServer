[Course_Description]
Onboarding is the process of welcoming users to an app and driving them to act: to sign up, set preferences, shop, or engage. In this course, Emmanuel Henri steps through the process of designing a simple and user-friendly application onboarding experience using Sketch and InVision. Learn how to research design concepts and find inspiration, create initial assets in Balsamiq, build out interactive prototypes in Sketch, and collaborate on the prototypes in InVision. Emmanuel shows how to create many different types of screens, including welcome and call-to-action screens, so you have plenty of examples to build out your own onboarding experience.
