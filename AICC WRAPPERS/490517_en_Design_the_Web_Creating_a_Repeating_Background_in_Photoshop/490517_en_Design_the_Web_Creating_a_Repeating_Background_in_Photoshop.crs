[Course_Description]
Learn how to create an optimized repeating background for websites and applications with Adobe Photoshop. Design the Web</em< author Chris Converse shows how to tile and edit just about any image (disguising the seams with lighting adjustments, filter offsets, and creative masking techniques), export a web-optimized version of the graphic, and preview it in a browser. The process repeats in chapter 2, where Chris shows how to tile the image across the horizontal and vertical axes. The exercise files included with this course are free to all members.
