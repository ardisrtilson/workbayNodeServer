You're a graphic designer who often needs photography in your projects. What do you need to know to be able to generate photos yourself—or be able to effectively communicate to a photographer you've hired? In this course, photographer, author, and educator Ben Long details the concepts and techniques that graphic designers should know about in order to work with photography more effectively. The course begins with a look at logistical and legal considerations, from composing for a layout to budgeting to obtaining permissions and releases. Next, Ben tackles the kind of assignment you might find yourself taking on—shooting a variety of different types of photos that are required for a print piece. The course concludes with guidance on where to go next to further your photography skills.
