[Course_Description]
Not everything you create in CINEMA 4D has to be photorealistic. Sometimes you want a line art look. Sketch and Toon is the C4D module that allows you to apply flat shading to 3D artwork and create 2D-style, cel-shaded motion graphics with a click of a button. These tutorials introduce Sketch and Toon to 3D mograph artists who want to emulate this 2D style. EJ Hassenfratz follows a real-world workflow, from applying a 2D look to 3D objects, to animating the objects and strokes, to completing a final render. Along the way, he'll dive deeper into line types, the Cel Shader, and Sketch Style tagsâ€”features that help mograph artists achieve just the results they want from this fun and creative module.
