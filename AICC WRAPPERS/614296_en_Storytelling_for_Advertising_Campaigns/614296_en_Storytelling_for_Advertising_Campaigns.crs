[Course_Description]
Storytelling has become an agency buzzword. From creative directors to copywriters, it seems everyone is a storyteller these days. And the fact is, they're right. We are all storytellers. But few of us are story builders, capable of not only understanding the structure of story but able to use it to connect the character of a brand to the people that consume it. In this course, Stefan Mumaw lays out the structure of story and uses the development of a real-world campaign to show how each story component builds an emotional bridge between brand and consumer. He breaks down how that story translates to the various advertising components that creatives often use in a real-world campaign, like TV spots, print ads, websites, and social content.
