[Course_Description]
Learn to use and analyze basic pen-testing scripts, while you study for the CompTIA PenTest+ certification exam—the gold standard for professional penetration testers. Scripting is an invaluable tool for pen testers, making their work repeatable, faster, and less prone to error. While you might not need to write your own scripts, qualified pen testers should be able to recognize and use a wide variety of scripts in different programming languages. This course reviews the four most popular: Bash, PowerShell, Ruby, and Python. Each video breaks down the syntax and strengths of the language and analyzes a sample script. Michael closes with a comparison video that helps you practice your skills at identifying each scripting language. This Total Seminars course covers the exam certification topics.
