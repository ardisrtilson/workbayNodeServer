[Course_Description]
Adobe After Effects is the standard for motion graphics—a must for anyone who wants to create motion designs for the web, video, or any type of screen delivery. However, many nonvideo professionals feel intimidated by After Effects because it looks so different from what they’re used to. In this course, Luisa Winters covers the basics of After Effects in a nontechnical way. Explore the most essential component of animation—keyframes—and different keyframe interpolation techniques. Discover how to animate text and text properties such as opacity and color. Find out how to build and animate masks and use masks from other programs such as Illustrator and Photoshop. Finally, learn how to export your work for a variety of formats using the Render Queue and Adobe Media Encoder. This course was created by Rhed Pixel. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
