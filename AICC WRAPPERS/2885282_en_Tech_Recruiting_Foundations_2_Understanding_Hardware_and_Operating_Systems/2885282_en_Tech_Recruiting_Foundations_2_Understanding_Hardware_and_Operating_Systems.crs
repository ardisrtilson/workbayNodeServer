[Course_Description]
Tech is one of those rare places where demand for jobs is higher than the supply. With that in mind, how can recruiters and hiring managers get the best candidates for the job into the jobs theyâ€™re trying to fill? One way is by understanding the tech well enough to know exactly what you need. In this series of courses, instructor Ayub Shaikh goes over high-level IT concepts and breaks them into related, easy-to-remember groupings. This course focuses specifically on hardware and operating systems. Ayub shows you a variety of hardware that may impact what skill set you need for an IT position, such as PCs, servers, mainframes, supercomputers, serverless API frameworks, and more. He explains operating system specifics, including what an operating system does, open and closed systems, and how Linux differs from other operating systems.
