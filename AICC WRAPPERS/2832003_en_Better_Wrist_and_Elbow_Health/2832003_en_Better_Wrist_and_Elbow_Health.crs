[Course_Description]
Join Dr. Baxter Bell as he introduces you to this series on wrist and elbow health. Conditions like tennis elbow and carpal tunnel can be a result of repetitive and long-term mouse and keyboard use. These exercises help prevent the common pains that plague people who work at desks and computers. Baxter shares a simple antidote for tired, tight wrists and hands, as he guides you through a series of exercises to open up the upper back, shoulders, and arms. Follow along and unlock the potential to feel more open and pliable. Happier wrists and hands are the immediate result. This course was created by Desk Yogi. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
