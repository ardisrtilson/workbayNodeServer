Video editors look to enhance their projects by using motion graphic templates to spice up their work. In this course, learn how to work with and create After Effects text templates that you can modify later in Adobe Premiere Pro. Nick Harauz breaks down how complicated templates are designed, and how to get more comfortable with tweaking them. Plus, he shows how to create your own mosaic template to update inside of Premiere.
