[Course_Description]
Phishing and whaling are types of cybercrime used to defraud people and organizations. The average 10,000-employee company spends $3.7 million dollars a year dealing with phishing and whaling attacks alone. It's imperative that all employees of an organization are educated on how to avoid these attacks. Phishing is successful when an email message persuades a person to take an action or reveal information which should not be disclosed. Whaling focuses on high-profile targets such as executives, politicians, and celebrities.Â Learn about the tactics used in phishing and whaling, and view some examples so that you can identify suspicious emails and network intrusions. Then learn how to reduce your risk and put protections in place to help mitigate these threats. This course was created and produced by Mentor Source, Inc.
