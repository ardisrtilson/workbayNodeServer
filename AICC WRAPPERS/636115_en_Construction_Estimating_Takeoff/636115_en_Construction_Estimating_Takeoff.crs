[Course_Description]
Takeoffs are one of the most common documents prepared by professional construction estimators. A takeoff lists the materials needed to complete a job. It includes quantities and measurements, and should be as accurate and detailed as possible. This course provides step-by-step instructions for developing a takeoff—including counts, units, notes, and labor estimates—in the correct sequence. Learn how to measure area, length, and volume, and get tips on how to work more efficiently and avoid some of the most common takeoff mistakes.
