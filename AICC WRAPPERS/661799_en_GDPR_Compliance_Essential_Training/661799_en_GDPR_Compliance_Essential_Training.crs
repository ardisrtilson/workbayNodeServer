[Course_Description]
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new privacy-related regulation in the EU that will become active and enforceable in May of 2018. GDPR requires US companies doing business in the EU to protect citizen privacy, and companies who do not comply will face heavy fines. This course is intended to outline who needs to do this, what they need to do, and how they need to do it. Learn about the scope of GDPR, the definition of a personal data breach, the rights of data subjects, incident response requirements under GDPR, and more.
