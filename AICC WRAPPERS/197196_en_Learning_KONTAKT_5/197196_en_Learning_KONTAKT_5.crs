This quick Up and Running course demonstrates the power of KONTAKT, arguably the world's best software sampler. KONTAKT's lush sample libraries, powerful routing, and intuitive UI make creating sophisticated sounds and performance setups a breeze. Here, J. Scott Giaquinta provides a brief overview of the features, signal routing, and effects, and shows how to chop up loops and utilize time stretching, pitch shifting, and scripting. Then he'll demonstrate some creative ways to make sounds with KONTAKT's FX modules and automation.
