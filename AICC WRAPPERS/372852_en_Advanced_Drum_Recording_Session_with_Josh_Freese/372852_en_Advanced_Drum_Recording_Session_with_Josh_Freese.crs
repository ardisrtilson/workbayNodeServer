[Course_Description]
In this course, GRAMMY-winning recording engineer, producer, and mixer Ryan Hewitt explains his techniques for capturing drum sounds in one of the best recording rooms in Los Angeles, EastWest Studio 2. Utilizing the talents of A-list session and touring drummer Josh Freese (interviewed in the first chapter of the course), Ryan will demonstrate his mic choice and placements on Josh's drums, spending time on the details of the kick, snare, toms, cymbals, overheads, and room mic setups. Ross Garfield, the Drum Doctor, assists in fine-tuning the drum sound. Watch for a one-of-a-kind look at the pros at work. Check out how Ryan prepared for Josh's session in the first course, Drum Setup and Mic'ing in the Studio.
