Digital and variable data printing offer an incredible array of possibilities. Think banners, vehicle wraps, and custom-printed books. But with possibilities come stock and finishing limitations, which those using this versatile technology need to know. In this course Claudia McCue reviews the types of projects that are appropriate for digital printing, the impact of digital color, and how variable data can allow you to personalize your digital print jobs. She also explores the possibilities beyond paper, like edible ink. At the end of this course, designers will feel more confident when they choose digital printing for their next job.
