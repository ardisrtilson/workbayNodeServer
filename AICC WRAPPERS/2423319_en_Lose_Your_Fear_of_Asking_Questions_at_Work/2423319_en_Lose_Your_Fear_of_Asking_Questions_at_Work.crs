[Course_Description]
It may seem simple and obvious to say that asking questions is often the fastest path to an answer or discovery. Yet so many people dread asking questions, particularly at work. Whether out of fear of seeming incapable or a well-meaning attempt to avoid taking up someone else’s time, many people avoid asking questions. In this audio-only course adapted from the Modern Mentor podcast, Rachel Cooke shows that asking questions doesn’t mean you’re weak; it means you’re wise. She provides example scenarios and practical tips to help you better understand how to craft strategic questions that will enable you to connect with others, expand your ideas, and present yourself as a curious leader. With Rachel’s guidance, you’ll be ready to overcome your fear of asking questions in a professional setting and better prepared to confidently pose authentic, smart questions that will further your career.
