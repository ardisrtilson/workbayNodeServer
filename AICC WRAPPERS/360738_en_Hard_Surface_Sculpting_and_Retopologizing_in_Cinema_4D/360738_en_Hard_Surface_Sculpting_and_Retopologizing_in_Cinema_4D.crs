[Course_Description]
Using CINEMA 4D's sculpting tools, you can create hard surface models without the constraints imposed by traditional polygon and NURBS modeling techniques. Then you can retopologize your sculpt to produce a lighter model more suitable for complex scenes and animation. Your sculpted model becomes, in essence, a frame around which you can build a well-constructed polygon model. In this course, modeling expert Adam Trachtenberg shows viewers how to use the sculpting tools in C4D to create a hard surface model, retopologize the sculpted model, return to sculpting mode to add fine details, and generate texture maps that approximate the illusion of detailâ€”without the weight of polygons. He demonstrates the steps using a fantasy spaceship model, the kind you'd see in professional video games, television, or feature films. Watch and learn how to use these techniques to build your own.
