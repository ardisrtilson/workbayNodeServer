[Course_Description]
Not a graphic designer? No problem. In this course, staff author and designer Justin Seeley shares graphic design secrets anyone can apply to make their business documents look great. No graphic design knowledge necessary! Justin breaks graphic design into an easy-to-follow acronym, PARC, or proximity, alignment, repetition, and contrast, and shows how to apply these principles to everyday design challenges. He also shows how to use the two major tools in a designer's arsenal, typography and color, to grab attention and set the appropriate mood for your documents. Then you'll work together on four different design projects that you might encounter in any office: a business card, an envelope, a flyer, and even a presentation.
