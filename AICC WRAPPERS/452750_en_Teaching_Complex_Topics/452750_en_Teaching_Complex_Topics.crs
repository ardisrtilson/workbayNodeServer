[Course_Description]
Teaching is more than just delivering content; it's about making complex ideas understandable and guiding learners to higher-order thinking. A successful approach to teaching complex topics involves three phases: systematically unpacking the material, turning it into engaging and effective lessons, and then providing extra assistance to students who are struggling. Combined with Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles for making learning accessible, you can maximize student engagement and achievementâ€”with even the most complex subjects. Karin Hutchinson is an experienced teacher who now helps other educators find new ways to teach. She starts off this course with a quick overview of learning theory, focusing on how students gain new knowledge. These theories set the stage for Karin's framework for making learning accessible to a variety of learning styles (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic), making lessons engaging with gamification and choice, and scaffolding instruction to help guide learners who need extra help.
