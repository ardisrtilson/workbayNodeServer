[Course_Description]
With Illustrator Draw—a vector drawing app from Adobe that's a companion to Illustrator—you can create illustrations on your iPhone, iPad, iPad Pro, or Android phone or tablet. In this course, Tony Harmer shows how to get started with this versatile app. Tony explains how to choose and pair a stylus and start drawing using the different brushes available in the app. He demonstrates how to choose colors, use French curves, and work with both draw layers and image layers. He also takes you through advanced drawing techniques such as using blend modes and several drawing tips. To wrap up the course, he goes beyond Illustrator Draw and explains how to send your work to Illustrator, Photoshop, and Behance.
