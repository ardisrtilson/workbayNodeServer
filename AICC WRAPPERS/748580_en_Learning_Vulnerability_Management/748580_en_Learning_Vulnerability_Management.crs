[Course_Description]
Some people think that vulnerability management just means patching OS systems, but it's so much more than that. Vulnerability management is something every organization needs to address; however, many don't understand the mechanics and breadth of the challenge. This course provides those without prior experience in the area an overview of why vulnerabilities exist, as well as an explanation of the process of managing them from start to finish. Instructor Lora Vaughn McIntosh covers the three key components of vulnerability management and the tools needed to establish a program of your own. Get an introduction to vulnerability scanning and reporting, learn how to identify which vulnerabilities to address first, discover how to vet false positives, and more.
