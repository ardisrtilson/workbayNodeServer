[Course_Description]
The tintype was one of the earliest forms of photography—but it's alive and well today. A passionate group of photographers has embraced tintypes and other historical processes for their unique look and for the sheer pleasure of engaging in handmade photography. Photographer and educator Tim Grey visits with Geoffrey Berliner, a master of analog photography and the owner of what might be the world's largest collection of vintage lenses. Berlinger is the executive director of the Penumbra Foundation, a New York–based nonprofit that conducts workshops on numerous historical photo processes. Learn how modern tintype portraits are made at Penumbra Studios, using vintage cameras and lenses, fresh plates, and raw chemicals.
