[Course_Description]
Learn how to use Photoshop, After Effects, and two dedicated tools—Flixel and Cliplets—to explore the creative possibilities of cinemagraphs: static photos that contain areas of motion. Rich Harrington explores assembly techniques in each program and illustrates effective shooting and post-production techniques to improve the end results. The final cinemagraphs can be used in websites, banner ads, emails, presentations, or even digital signage.
