[Course_Description]
Having a sales process is critical to a salesperson's success. But a process isn't enough if you don't follow it on each and every call. Turning your sales process into a habit that feels natural is the key. In this course, CEO and author Jeff Bloomfield helps you create a sales process that is easy to follow, keeps you on track, and helps consistently close sales. He teaches you the difference between a sales process and sales methodology and shows how to close the gap between philosophy and strategy. He then helps you define and map your sales process—from understanding your buyer to reporting results—and set the expectations for the actual conversation: what you should know, do, say, and show. Follow along and learn how to create your own winning formula to turn prospects into customers—one step at a time.
