This series, Capturing Audio for Video, demystifies sound capture, offering professional insights along with practical tips and tricks. Here you'll learn how to deal with real-world audio issues in talking head, long shot, and multi-actor scenes. Jeff also introduces specialized solutions for dealing with wind, environmental noise, sound for B-roll, room tone, and more.
