[Course_Description]
The start of a career is an exciting yet vulnerable place to be. You have the freshness and energy on your side, but you also have very little experience with how your industry and your new company actually work. The good news is you’re not alone. We’ve all been there before. This course brings together advice from a diverse set of experts, such as Oscar-winning actor Ed Norton and Adam Grant, the youngest tenured professor at Wharton. They explain how to develop a fearless mindset and build the productivity and networking skills you need to succeed in a new role. By understanding the dynamics that early-career employees face and “managing up” by building strong relationships, you can gain the confidence and support you’ll need to thrive. This course includes videos from: Edward Norton, Oscar-winning actor and founder of CrowdRise Kathryn Minshew, founder and CEO of The Muse, a career-discovery platform Adam Grant, Wharton professor and expert in motivation and behavior Sarah Robb O'Hagan, executive, activist, entrepreneur, and the CEO of Flywheel Sports Simon O. Sinek, author of Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action Note: This course was produced by Big Think. We are pleased to host this content in our library.
