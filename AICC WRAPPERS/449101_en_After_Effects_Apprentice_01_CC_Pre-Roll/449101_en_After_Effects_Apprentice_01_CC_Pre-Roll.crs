[Course_Description]
This short course is designed for new users of Adobe After Effects CC, and those who might need a refresher—especially when moving to Creative Cloud. Chris Meyer leads a whirlwind tour of After Effects, helping overcome the blank canvas fear that confronts many new motion graphics artists the first time they launch the application. It's an excellent introduction to the After Effects Apprentice series, and a great overview for any new user starting an After Effects training program. Start watching to learn how to customize the interface, import and interpret footage, preview work, and render and export your compositions. If you are still using a pre–Creative Cloud version of After Effects, such as CS6, we suggest you watch After Effects Apprentice 01: CS Pre-Roll instead. There have been numerous changes to the After Effects interface, especially in the area of previewing.
