[Course_Description]
Learn how to design a business card. In this course, designer Nigel French covers all aspects of the design process—from font choice to paper stock—so you can create a business card that is at once eye-catching and functional. He walks through what information to include, size and format considerations, and printing options. He also demonstrates how to set up a template and incorporate typography and imagery. Then he segues into two hands-on projects: a business card for a graphics design company and another for a coffee shop. These projects will help you understand how to apply the principles of good design in real-world context.
