[Course_Description]
Join professional songwriter Cliff Goldmacher as he shares his insights on the songwriting process and on what it takes to make it in the music business as a songwriter. He begins by discussing how to write, edit, and finish songs: starting from a title or lyrical hook, a melodic idea, a chord progression or groove, or a general concept. Once the song is done, Cliff demonstrates how to prepare a lyric sheet, create a rough demo recording, and catalogue your song. He then discusses things songwriters can do to stay motivated. Next, he discusses how to move your songwriting career forward—while employing patience—and emphasizes the importance of working hard. Cliff finishes the course by debunking several songwriting myths.
