[Course_Description]
It only takes one misconfigured device or missing patch for hackers to infiltrate your network. Fix the flaws in your systems before attackers can find them with Nessus, the network vulnerability scanner popular among cybersecurity analysts, sys admins, and network engineers. Using Nessus, you can scan servers, endpoints, and other network devices and check them against a database of thousands of known vulnerabilities. In this course, instructor Mike Chapple teaches you how to install Nessus, configure scans, and interpret the output. He explains how to create a vulnerability management program as well as a remediation workflow that will help you detect, understand, and resolve vulnerabilities before they are exploited.
