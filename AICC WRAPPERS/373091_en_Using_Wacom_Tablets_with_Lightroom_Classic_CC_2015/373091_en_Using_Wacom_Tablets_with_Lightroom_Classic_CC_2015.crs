[Course_Description]
A Wacom tablet is a great addition to a photographic workflow. A pen and tablet offer more control over lighting and tonal adjustments, retouching, and even creative work like compositing. But are you getting the most out of your tools? In this course, Adobe Certified Instructor Kevin Stohlmeyer shows how to optimize your Wacom tablet for use with Lightroom Classic CC. He reviews each component of the tablet and Grip Pen and shows how to adjust preferences and customize your tablet to work best with Lightroom Classic CC. Plus, he explores how the Wacom tools extend the power of Lightroom's Adjustment Brush and healing tools, and how to get the most out of the ExpressKeys.
