[Course_Description]
In many organizations, financial management processes and activities drive behaviors and decisionsâ€” which limits people's capabilities to continuously improve, experiment in areas of great uncertainty, reduce real risks, and innovate. In this course, one of eight in the Lean Technology Strategy series, Joanne Molesky talks about different ways to look at financial management to remove barriers to experimentation, innovation, and improved value delivery to your customers. Review the pitfalls of classic financial management, alternative models, and ways to plan for the future and create rolling forecasts. This course was created by Joanne Molesky. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
