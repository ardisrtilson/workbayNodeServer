[Course_Description]
Studio portraits can sometimes benefit from the visual interest a new backdrop can provide. In this installment of Portrait Project, Chris Orwig shows how to remove a subject from a studio environment and place her against a different background. First, Chris shows how to crop the portrait and improve details in Camera Raw. Then, in Photoshop, he shows how to make a selection, refine its edges, and convert it to a mask, and combine it with another image. In the second half of the course, he covers how to make the subject look at home in her new environment using a hand-painted darkening effect, blur, and color and tone adjustments.
