A syllabus should clearly communicate the scope and requirements of a course to students. It must be carefully crafted and organized, and accurately set expectations around course participation, assignments, and gradingâ€”all while meeting the specific requirements of your institution. Learn how to set up your students and your class for success by writing a well-organized and complete syllabus. Author Karl Kapp walks teachers through the various sections of a common syllabus, with best practices for making the syllabus a more valuable tool in any class. Learn what to leave in and what to leave out, how to add policies and grading criteria, and how to summarize exactly what students will accomplish by the end of the course. Plus, get tips for distributing a digital syllabus for an online class.
