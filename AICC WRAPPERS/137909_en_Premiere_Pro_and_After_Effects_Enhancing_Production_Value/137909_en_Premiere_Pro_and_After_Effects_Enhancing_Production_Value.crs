[Course_Description]
Have you ever been handed substandard footage and have a client expect you to spin this straw into gold? In this course, motion graphics veteran and After Effects expert Chris Meyer shares his favorite tricks to take boring footage and create a more professional, compelling result. Most of these tricks can be performed inside Adobe Premiere Pro without the need for third-party effects. Some techniques also use After Effects, taking advantage of Dynamic Link, which makes the changes appear directly in your Premiere Pro timeline. The results add polish and production valueâ€”without missing deadlines or blowing the budget. This course was created and produced by Chris and Trish Meyer.
