[Course_Description]
Value is the new buzzword in consulting—and for good reason. People buy value, not just products and services. Consultants who maximize the value created for their clients can command a pricing premium and deliver better results. This course teaches consultants what value is, and how to identify and communicate the value they provide to the people they serve. Author, CEO, and coach Robbie Baxter shows how to connect value to your pricing—whether it's for accounting or design services—and handle challenges, from avoiding being seen as a commodity to moving beyond an hourly role. She also provides questions and frameworks to pinpoint your unique value and move to a pricing strategy that better reflects your worth.
