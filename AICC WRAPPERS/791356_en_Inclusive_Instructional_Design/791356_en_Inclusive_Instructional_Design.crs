[Course_Description]
Does the training you create really reflect your audience? Have you considered someone’s geographical location, learning preference, or accommodation needs? These types of questions should be core to the instructional design process. In this course, learn how to make sure your training is inclusive by considering everything from your graphics to the subject matter experts (SMEs) you select. Instructor Samantha Calamari illuminates ways in which individuals with different learning styles, abilities, and cultural backgrounds can be left out of traditional learning experiences. Throughout the course, she shares techniques and design methods that can help your training resonate with these—and all potential—audiences.
