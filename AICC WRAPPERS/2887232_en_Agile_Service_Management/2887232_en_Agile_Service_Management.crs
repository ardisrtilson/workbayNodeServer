[Course_Description]
Service management is the mental model behind ITSM tools like ServiceNow, Nexthink, and HappySignals, as well as the roles, workflows, and information that help you support and deliver the products and services you offer. This course from instructor David Pultorak explains the necessity of service management and how it can best work in an agile environment. David covers the basics of service management—what it is, why it’s important, and practical tips on how to use it. He talks about the stakeholders you must tend to, and the journeys and experiences they take with you. He also imparts his ideas on how to better stage and conduct interactions. As David shows, when individuals, teams, and organizations grasp these concepts, it can make a big difference in everyone’s day-to-day work life.
