[Course_Description]
VMware vSphere is everywhere. Nonvirtualized data centers are a thing of the past; in order to stay relevant—and scale infrastructure to meet business needs—you must understand vSphere. vSphere 6.7 Foundations is an eight-part series designed for anyone who wants to learn vSphere, including absolute beginners, and develop the knowledge to pass the VMware vSphere 6.7 Foundations exam (2V0-01.19). In this course, instructor Rick Crisci reviews the resource management features in vSphere 6.7, including the Distributed Resource Scheduler. Learn how to set up affinity rules, patch environments in maintenance mode, set up automation, and ensure high availability with resource fragmentation. This course was created by Rick Crisci. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
