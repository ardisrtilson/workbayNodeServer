[Course_Description]
Companies around the world view sustainability as a strategic imperative. This course is for employees who want to support that imperative on an individual level. Learn about how personal and collective sustainability actions can help solve the biggest challenges of our lifetime: climate change, land and ocean degradation, and overconsumption. Dr. Elizabeth Bagley, a scientist, educator, and sustainability expert, introduces the concept of sustainability—what it is, why it’s important, and why you should care—and distills the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals into clear actions for individuals seeking ways to live and work more sustainably. Discover how you can support sustainability initiatives in your organization, start your own sustainability initiatives, and participate in actions that will have an impact on the biggest environmental challenges of our lifetime.
