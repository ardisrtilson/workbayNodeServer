[Course_Description]
From scrum to Six Sigma, there's an abundance of options for architecting an organization's workflow. And since there's no one-size-fits-all approach to software development, it's important for software project managers, architects, and team leads to grasp the different options at their disposal before making a decision that affects the budgeting, staffing, and management of software delivery. This course zooms out on the software development landscape to provide a high-level look at a variety of software development life cycle (SDLC) approachesâ€”from traditional methods to more modern processes. Instructor Shashi Shekhar provides a brief overview of each method, highlighting how each one is unique and can be applicable today. Learn about lean, kanban, DevOps, and more.
