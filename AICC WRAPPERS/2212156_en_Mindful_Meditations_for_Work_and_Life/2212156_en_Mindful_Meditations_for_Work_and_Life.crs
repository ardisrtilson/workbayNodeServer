[Course_Description]
You can be successful at work while maintaining a calm, Zen-like approach to your daily decisions and routines. Meditation and mental exercises like visualization can help you manage stress and create the life you want. This audio course led by Scott Shute, head of the Mindfulness and Compassion program at LinkedIn, offers a practical and easy approach to meditation, including simple, short exercises that you can build into a regular practiceâ€”even in the minutes before a meeting. Learn the science underlying the brain-body connection and how adapting your posture and changing your position can help you relax. Explore different kinds of breathing exercises, and discover visualization and loving-kindness techniques to open your mind and your heart. Scott closes with some advice for making your practice stick and integrate meditation into a busy schedule.
