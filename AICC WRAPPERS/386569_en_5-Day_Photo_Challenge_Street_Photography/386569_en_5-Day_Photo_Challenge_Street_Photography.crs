[Course_Description]
Take a five-day photo challenge that will help you look at your city and the people who live there in new ways. Author Steve Simon provides five challenges: working with light and reflections, isolating subjects, shooting at night, and overcoming nervousness by approaching strangers. He shares his own solutions as he works the streets of New York City, but you can follow along from anywhere. At the end of each day, remember to share your work with LinkedIn Learning's community of photographers using the hashtag #5DayPhoto.
