[Course_Description]
What distinguishes a good leader from an ineffective or even harmful leader? Weâ€™ve probably all worked under different kinds of leaders, from a jaded and apathetic leader who goes through the motions and sucks the life out of an environment, to a great leader who constantly tries to take their team and people to the next level. In this audio-only course adapted from the How to be Awesome at Your Job podcast, Jeremie Kubicek talks about what separates a good leader from a bad one. He details the importance of a leader assessing themselves not just in respect to their team at work, but in five key categories: self, family, team, organization, and community. Jeremie also discusses the Support Challenge Matrix, through which one can measure whether someone under you needs more support or challenge. By the end of this course, it will be clear how good leaders manage to multiply the effect of their leadership many times over. This course was created by Pete Mockaitis of How to Be Awesome at Your Job. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
