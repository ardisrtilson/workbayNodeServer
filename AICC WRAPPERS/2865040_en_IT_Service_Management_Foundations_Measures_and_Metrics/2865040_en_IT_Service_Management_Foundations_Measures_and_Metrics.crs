[Course_Description]
Every organization uses metrics and measurements to determine where they are, and where they want to be. But do you know how to create these metrics and properly measure them to drive actions across your organization? In this course, learn why you should start with the overall organizational vision when developing metrics; how to create proper objectives and measure them using indicators; and how to pick the right metrics to measure what matters. Using standard terminology and best practices from the ITIL® framework, instructor Jason Dion goes over the five types of measures used to track progress. He covers various measurement models, such as the planning and evaluation model, the balanced scorecard, and the organizational improvement cascade. Plus, learn about the assessment methods commonly used in today's digital organizations.
