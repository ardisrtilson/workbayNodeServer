[Course_Description]
Join Wayne Baker, professor of business administration at the University of Michigan and author of All You Have To Do Is Ask, as he teaches you how to make the powerful skill of asking for what you need a daily habit. Learn how to decide on your goals and determine what you need to achieve them. Figure out who to ask for those resources and how to reach out to them using your networks and connections. Discover how to ask to make “yes” the most likely answer, how to turn a “no” into a successful new ask, and how to return the favor or pay it forward.
