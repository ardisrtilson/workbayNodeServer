People around the world are having difficult conversations about race and justice. But few are talking about how to talk about race. This has left some professionals sitting on the sidelines because they don't know what to say or how to say it. In this course, negotiation and conflict resolution expert Kwame Christian shows how to apply a useful framework to open up an effective dialogue at work and facilitate understanding. Kwame highlights the barriers that make talking about race so challenging. He then shares how to apply a framework that provides a consistent tool for how to have these conversations. Using this framework, you can acknowledge and validate emotions, use curiosity to open up dialogue, and work with others to determine what you're trying to solve. Plus, Kwame shares general tips for talking about race, including how to avoid common pitfalls and talk to your kids about race and society.
