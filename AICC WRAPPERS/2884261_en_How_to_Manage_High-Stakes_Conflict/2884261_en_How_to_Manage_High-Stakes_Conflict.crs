[Course_Description]
Conflict seems unavoidable in life, but how can we wind down and diffuse anger, especially when thereâ€™s a lot on the line? In this audio-only course, adapted from the Negotiate Anything podcast, Justice Yvette McGee Brown explains how to present conflict, have constructive conversations with those who have different viewpoints, and find your specific approach to resolving conflict. In addition to her work on the Ohio Supreme Court, Justice Brown served on the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, was the founding President of the non-profit Center for Child and Family Advocacy, and presently works as the Partner-in-Charge of Diversity, Inclusion & Advancement for the Jones Day law firm. Note: This course was created by the American Negotiation Institute. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
