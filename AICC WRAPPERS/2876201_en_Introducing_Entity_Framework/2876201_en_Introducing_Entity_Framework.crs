Cam shows you how to reverse engineer an existing database for use with EF Core. He explains that ASP.NET and EF Core are a perfect match to accelerate your web app development. He demonstrates how to use SQLite and Azure Cosmos database providers with EF Core. Cam concludes by exploring several ways you can optimize your EF Core code.
