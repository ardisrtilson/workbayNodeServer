[Course_Description]
Want to develop character concepts for the film and game industries? In this course, concept artist Rayce Bird shows how to bring creatures from the depths of your imagination to life with ZBrush and Photoshop. He'll cover sketching out ideas in Photoshop, generating the basic form with Dynamesh, and adding details to the sculpture with the rest of the tools in Zbrush. Then, once the creature is painted, textured, and lit, Rayce will show how to render it out and composite it into a scene that reveals more of the story behind the character.
