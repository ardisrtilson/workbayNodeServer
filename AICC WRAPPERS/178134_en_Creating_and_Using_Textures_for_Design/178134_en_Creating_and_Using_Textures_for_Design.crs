[Course_Description]
For all the benefits computers provide, the designs that result from an all-digital workflow can come off as too clean and too cold. By reintroducing natural elements in your artwork, you can bring back an authentic and tactile visual quality. In this course, Von Glitschka shows how to collect and enhance real-world textures and integrate them into your digital designs. Great texture is all around; Von will teach you how to hunt for it, in nature and in places as unlikely as a parking lot. Once you've captured your textures, he'll show you how to convert them into formats suitable for a digital workflow, and put them to use in assorted Photoshop and Illustrator designs.
