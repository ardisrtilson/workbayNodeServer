What makes a photo work? When is an image considered successful? In this weekly series, photography expert Steve Simon critiques images captured by all levels of photographers, from hobbyist to professional. He provides insights about how the elements in an image affect its interpretation so you can decide what to include—and exclude—from the frame when out shooting or when cropping in post. Additionally, he shares technical and non-technical remarks, covering choices like aperture, shutter speed, and lighting. As he reviews images, he notes the strengths exhibited while also identifying opportunities for refinement, and points out changes that could vary the meaning conveyed in the final image. Check back each week to watch as more critiques are added, covering new work from many different genres. This series is designed to help you discover how to improve your work as a photographer. By heightening your awareness through analysis, you can harness the information to enhance your photographic eye. Note: Because this is an ongoing series, viewers will not receive a certificate of completion.
