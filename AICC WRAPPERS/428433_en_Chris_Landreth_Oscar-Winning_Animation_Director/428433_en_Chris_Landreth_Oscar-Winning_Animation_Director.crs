Chris Landreth broke out with his Oscar-winning animated short, Ryan. Now he conducts research on facial expressions and body language and helps a brand-new generation of animators make the connection between technical prowess, insight, and artistry. In this interview, he answers question about his current projects, his research, and his next big endeavor: a feature-length animated documentary.
