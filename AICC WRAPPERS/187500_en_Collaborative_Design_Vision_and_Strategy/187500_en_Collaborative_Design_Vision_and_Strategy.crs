[Course_Description]
Beneath the surface of great design—where the color palettes, fonts, and graphics live—lies a strong core vision. Creating that vision requires what Lauren Bacon calls deep collaboration with your clients. When you can get inside the heads of the people you're designing for, you can do extraordinary work. In this course, Lauren teaches you how to listen, ask better questions, and collaborate more effectively with clients and other stakeholders, in order to develop a project vision and strategy that results in better, more effective designs. This course is part of the Collaborative Design series.
