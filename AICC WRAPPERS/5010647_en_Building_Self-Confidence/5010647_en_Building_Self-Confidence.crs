[Course_Description]
Confidence is crucial to personal and professional success. People who aren't confident tend to miss out on new challenges, relationships, and opportunities. The good news is self-confidence is self-perpetuating; once you develop it, confidence can buoy you from one situation to the next. In this course, author and educator Dr. Todd Dewett shares simple and practical techniques to build and maintain self-confidence. In chapter one, he teaches you how to own the situation, embrace your imperfections, and take action to move forward. In chapter two, you can learn how to sustain your confidence, interaction after interaction, by aligning with the right people, maintaining a positive perspective, and putting together a plan.
