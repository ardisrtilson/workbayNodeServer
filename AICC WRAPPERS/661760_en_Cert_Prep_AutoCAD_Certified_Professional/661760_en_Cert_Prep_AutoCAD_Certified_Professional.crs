[Course_Description]
Become an AutoCAD certified professional. This training course helps you study for the Autodesk certification exam while you reinforce your CAD skills. Shaun Bryant helps you understand the two pathways available: Autodesk Certified User—for new designers who want to demonstrate basic proficiency—and Autodesk Certified Professional—for those who possess more advanced skills and can solve complex workflow and design challenges. He then walks through basic drawing skills, object manipulation techniques, and organization skills necessary to pass both certification exams. Plus, learn how to reuse content to be more efficient, annotate drawings, and set your AutoCAD designs up for printing. Note: The exam objectives are not release specific, but the course has been revised to reflect the most recent version of the software, AutoCAD 2018.
