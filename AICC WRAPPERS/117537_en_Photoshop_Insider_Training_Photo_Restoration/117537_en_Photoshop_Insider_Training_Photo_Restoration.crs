Repair prized photos with these insights from Adobe Photoshop Senior Product Manager Bryan O'Neil Hughes. First, learn how to convert your prints to digital files and leverage the power of Adobe Camera Raw to streamline the import process. Next, discover how to lay the groundwork for the restoration process with cropping, basic color and tone correction, and sharpening. Then see how to correct more serious damage such as scratches, rips, and staining, and how to enhance an image with borders and creative color. As a bonus, Bryan shares some rather unconventional but smart tips for getting the best results in Photoshop.
