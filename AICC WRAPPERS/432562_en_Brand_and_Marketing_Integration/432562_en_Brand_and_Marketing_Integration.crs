[Course_Description]
When the concept of marketing integration comes up, many people automatically think about external customer marketing; however, external approaches—advertising, social media, and event marketing, for example—are just one piece of the puzzle. In this course, Dina Shapiro shares a comprehensive brand and marketing integration approach that encompasses all external and internal stakeholders and touchpoints. Along with going over external marketing, Dina covers three other important types of integration: vertical, horizontal, and internal. She also explores common roadblocks and shows how to incorporate integration strategies into your own company.
