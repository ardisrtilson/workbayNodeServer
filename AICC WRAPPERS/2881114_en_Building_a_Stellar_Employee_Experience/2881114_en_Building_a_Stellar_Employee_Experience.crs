[Course_Description]
You've probably heard the phrase that employees are the lifeblood of any businessâ€”and it's true! Employees who are set up to be successful have a positive impact on the business, so it's important for you to dedicate time towards building positive employee experiences. This is no easy feat. It can be challenging to diagnose what creates positive employee experiences and even more difficult to actually create these experiences. In this course, industrial psychologist and executive coach Mary Kennett equips you with tools to shift focus back to your employees, strategies to recognize what is important to them, and methods to satisfy their workplace needs. Mary empowers you to craft a world class employee experience that will make your organization more successful. This course was created by Madecraft. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
