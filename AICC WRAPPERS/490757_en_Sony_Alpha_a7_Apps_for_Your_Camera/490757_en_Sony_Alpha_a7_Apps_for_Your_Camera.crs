[Course_Description]
Teach your Sony Alpha a7 some new tricks! Like many of Sony's Alpha-series cameras, the a7 models can run apps that extend the camera's features. You can even shop for and install apps directly with the camera. There are apps that enable you to do sophisticated light painting, high dynamic range (HDR) imaging, time-lapse movies, stop-motion animation, and much more. In this course, Rich Harrington takes you on a tour of the Sony app ecosystem, highlighting some of the best a7 apps and showing how to get the most out of them. The course is geared toward the a7 models, but its basic concepts apply to any Sony Alpha-series camera that is supported by Sony's PlayMemories store.
