[Course_Description]
Learn to create information-rich, visually compelling PowerPoint presentations driven by Excel data. The presentations you generate in this course are easy to use, easy to understand, and—best of all—easy to update. Gini von Courter begins with an example spreadsheet featuring typical business data. She uses conditional formatting to highlight important information, PivotTables to summarize data, and sparklines and charts to create illustrations. Next, she shows how to use several different methods, including copying and pasting, linking, and embedding, to import your work into PowerPoint. She then shows how to use PowerPoint animation features to animate Excel charts and tables and focus the viewer's attention. If you've wondered how to create expressive but low-maintenance presentations to showcase your data, this course is for you.
