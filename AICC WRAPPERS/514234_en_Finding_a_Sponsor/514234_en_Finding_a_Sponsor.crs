In our competitive workforce, it's crucial that you stand out from the other candidates vying for the same opportunities. Sponsors—individuals within an organization who see your potential and point you in the right direction—can help you define your personal brand and act as your advocate. In this course, executive coach Simon T. Bailey explains how sponsors can guide you along in your career. Learn about the differences between sponsors and mentors and discover how to assess and clarify your career goals, so you can choose the most appropriate sponsor. Once you identify and secure a sponsor, see how you can build a trusting relationship and continue to learn from them and their sphere of influence as you grow your career.
