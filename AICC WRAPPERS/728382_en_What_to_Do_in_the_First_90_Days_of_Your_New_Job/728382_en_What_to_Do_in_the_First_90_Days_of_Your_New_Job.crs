[Course_Description]
The first 90 days of a new job are crucial. Your boss will decide if you're the right fit for the job and whether you can deliver results. It's a fun time, but it's also really scary. Aimee Bateman, career expert and founder of Careercake.com, has placed over 4,000 people in their dream jobs. In this course, she breaks down those first 90 days for you, month by month, and outlines the activities you need to perform in order to make a real impact. Learn how to absorb all the new information, impress your boss and get along with your coworkers, and deliver the performance you promised in your interview. Plus, find out what to do if the job's not everything you expected it would be. This course was created by Careercake, the careers content platform. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
