[Course_Description]
Sometimes presenters get so wrapped up in creating the perfect slideshow, they forget its job is to support their talking points. In this course, instructor Rich Harrington shares his workflow for building an effective, well-organized PowerPoint presentation, starting with a strong outline. Learn how to create the outline, get input from collaborators, and then transition that outline to an initial slide deck. Once you're in PowerPoint, Rich shows you how to format your slides; add tables, graphics, videos, and animation (like transitions and reveals); and prepare and rehearse your presentation for your final audience. This course was created and produced by Rich Harrington.
