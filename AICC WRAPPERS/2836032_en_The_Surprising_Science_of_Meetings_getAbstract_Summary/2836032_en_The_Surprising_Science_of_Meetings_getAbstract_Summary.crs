[Course_Description]
Many managers regard inefficient, unproductive, or boring meetings as an unavoidable business flaw. In his popular book, The Surprising Science of Meetings, professor Steven G. Rogelberg challenges this assumption with ideas on how to stop wasting time and energy by facilitating better meetings. He bases his advice on research, best practices, and surveys. Rather than cancelling meetings, he says, improve them by being mindful and skillful about their design and delivery. In this audio-only summary of his book, produced by getAbstract, discover how to leverage Rogelberg’s strategies to improve your own meeting culture. Learn how long a meeting should last, how to determine which people to invite, how to boost participant ownership in your meetings, and more. This audiobook summary was created by getAbstract, the world’s largest provider of business book summaries. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
