[Course_Description]
An excellent logistics system delivers the right product to your customer at the right price, so understanding logistics is critical to your success. In this course, instructor Steven Brown shows you why logistics is important, what it is, and how logistics supports your company and your customers. Steven discusses how logistics must be effective and efficient. He explains steps to improve how a customerâ€™s order is filled. The course covers both outbound and inbound logistics and also goes over reverse logistics. More money is spent on transportation than on all other logistics functions combined, so Steven specifically takes you through different modes of transportation and how they often work together. He also shares the four cost tradeoffs in warehousing and goes into specific cost-efficient and value-added distribution center activities. The course steps through how logistics supports your marketing strategy, cuts across departments, and touches your customers.
