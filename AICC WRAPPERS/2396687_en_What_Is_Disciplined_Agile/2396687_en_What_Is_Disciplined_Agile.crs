[Course_Description]
The agile mindset is all about embracing uncertainty. But determining which agile methods suit your workflow can be a source of uncertainty in itself. Enter Disciplined Agile (DA). This industry-leading tool kit offers a people-first approach designed to help teams decide which agile methods to use based on the needs of a specific project. In this course, Sandy Mitchell—a project management expert with 25+ years of experience—provides a concise overview of DA, explaining what it is and how (and why) you might want to implement it. Learn the pros of adopting this approach and explore the three categories of the DA mindset: principles, promises, and guidelines. Plus, Sandy covers the scope of DA and the layers or levels of the DA tool kit, as well as essential DA concepts and their importance to the industry.
