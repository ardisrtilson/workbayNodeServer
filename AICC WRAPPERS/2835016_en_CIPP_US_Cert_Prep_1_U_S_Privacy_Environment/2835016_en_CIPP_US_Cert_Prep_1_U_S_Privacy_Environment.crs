[Course_Description]
The United States has a patchwork of privacy laws that affect different data types and industries in different ways. In this course, Mike Chapple explores the unique U.S. privacy environment, as covered by the first domain of the IAPP Certified Information Privacy Professional/US (CIPP/US) exam. He discusses the structure of U.S. law; enforcement of federal, state, and international privacy and security laws; and information management from a U.S. perspective. Students who complete this course will be prepared to answer questions from the Introduction to the U.S. Privacy Environment domain of the CIPP/US exam—a critical certification for privacy professionals—and create a more secure and controlled environment for their users.
