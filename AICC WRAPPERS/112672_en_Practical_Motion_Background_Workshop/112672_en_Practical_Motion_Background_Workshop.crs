[Course_Description]
Motion graphics production isn't limited to the digital world. This course takes you back into the studio to create custom motion backgrounds. Learn about lighting, staging, and filming everyday objects, which become an interesting, naturalistic footing for your motion effects. Author Rich Harrington shares techniques he uses in his own studio, RHED Pixel, to capture this footage and combine it with effects in popular postproduction tools like Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro, resulting in rich, abstract backdrops for your project. This course was created and produced by Rich Harrington. lynda.com is proud to host this content in our library.
