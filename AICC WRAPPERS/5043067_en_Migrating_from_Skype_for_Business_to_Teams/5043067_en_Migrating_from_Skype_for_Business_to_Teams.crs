[Course_Description]
If you're transitioning from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams, this brief course can help you get up to speed fast. Staff instructor Nick Brazzi begins with a quick primer on Teams—the new go-to collaboration and communication hub in Office 365—including how to access the tool on your desktop and mobile device. Nick shows how familiar features like messaging and file sharing work in Teams compared to Skype for Business. Next, Nick steps through audio calls, video calls, and group meetings in Teams, showing how to schedule and join meetings, share screens during a presentation, and record your meetings. Nick also introduces how to post group messages to teammates, which is a core communication feature in Teams that is not available in Skype for Business.
