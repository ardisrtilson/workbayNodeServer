[Course_Description]
Von Glitschka is back with another 5-day drawing challenge. In this installment, he provides some drawing inspiration. These challenges ask you to put away your normal drawing tools and draw outside your comfort zone. For example, day one involves white pigment on dark paper, while day four is about drawing with shapesâ€”and without lines. At the end of the five days, we hope you'll be inspired to stretch creatively and reach for new tools when you feel stuck in a routine. Remember: This series is designed for artists and nonartists alike. Don't be afraid to share your drawings with the rest of our community. Post them on Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using the hashtag #5DayDraw.
