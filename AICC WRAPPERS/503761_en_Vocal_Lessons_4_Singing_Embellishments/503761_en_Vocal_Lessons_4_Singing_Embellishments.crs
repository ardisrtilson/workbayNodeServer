[Course_Description]
Taking your voice to the next level requires practice—and sometimes a bit of embellishment. Embellishments are extra notes that can enhance the emotion and connection of a song, and are characteristic of many top-10 pop, country, jazz, and R&B tunes. Learn how to sing to stylize your vocal lines to fit your personality and build your confidence as an expressive singer, with these online singing lessons from top vocal coach Jeannie Deva. Part 4 of her comprehensive series introduces popular embellishments for multiple genres. These techniques are the same ones used by Jeannie's clients—Grammy-winning singers, Broadway actors, and top recording artists—and are guaranteed to produce noticeable improvements in your vocal range, tone, and style. Note: Vocal Lessons with Jeannie Deva was recorded and produced by ArtistWorks. We are honored to host this training in our library.
