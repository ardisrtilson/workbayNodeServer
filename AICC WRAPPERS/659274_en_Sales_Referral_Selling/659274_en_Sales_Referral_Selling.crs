[Course_Description]
Referrals offer the biggest competitive advantage of any sales tool out there—yet many teams aren't using referral selling as the primary way they prospect. Transform the way you work and build a sales pipeline full of qualified, low-cost leads with this simple tool. Joanne Black—speaker, author, and sales coach—explains why referrals work, and what gets in the way of asking for them. She shows how to earn introductions to prime prospects, ask for referrals in the right way, and leverage social media to widen your reach. The course includes worksheets to help you build out your referral process, as well as role-play scenarios that demonstrate how referral requests play out in real face-to-face conversations.
