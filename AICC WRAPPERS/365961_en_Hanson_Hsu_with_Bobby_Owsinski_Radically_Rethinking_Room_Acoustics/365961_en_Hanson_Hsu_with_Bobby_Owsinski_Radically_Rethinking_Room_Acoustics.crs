In this series, music producer Bobby Owsinski interviews iconic audio- and music-industry personalities: the outliers, forward thinkers, and rule breakers. This installment features studio designer Hanson Hsu.

In an effort to marry his technical and creative passions, he founded Delta H Design studio. At DHD, Hanson creates groundbreaking technologies that are redefining the acoustics industryâ€”and what it means to acoustically treat a music studio. In this interview, Bobby and Hanson chat about Hanson's career, influences, and the inspirations for his world-class studio designs.
