[Course_Description]
As more economies, communities, and businesses go global, more designers are being asked to adapt their layouts to work with different languages. This course will help you adapt English language design to Spanish, covering everything from translation to copyfitting, even if you don't know hola from hello. Diane Burns shows you how to take three examples (an existing sign, a flyer, and a catalog created in InDesign) and successfully convert them to Spanish. Along the way, she shares InDesign tips that will make you more productive in any language. Want to learn more? Check out Multilingual Publishing Strategies with InDesign.
