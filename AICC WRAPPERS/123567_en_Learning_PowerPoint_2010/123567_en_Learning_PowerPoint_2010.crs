In this workshop Tim Grey shares techniques for creating high-quality presentations with Microsoft PowerPoint 2010. After taking a tour of the interface, Tim shows how to plan and create a presentation, add and format text and graphics, and even create SmartArt that can be updated quickly and easily. If you want to go further, you can learn how to add charts and graphs, video or audio clips, and entrance and exit effects, and even how to make graphics float across the screen. Tips on fine-tuning and sharing your presentations round out the training.
