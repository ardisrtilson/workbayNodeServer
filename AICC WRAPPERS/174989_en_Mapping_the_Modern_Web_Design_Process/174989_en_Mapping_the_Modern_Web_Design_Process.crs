Once you eliminate the trends and terminology, web design is about one thing and one thing only: getting your message across to an online audience. This course offers a 10,000-foot view of the web design process, to help ensure you never lose sight of your users. Morten Rand-Hendriksen takes you on a journey from initial consultation and discovery through content strategy and UX considerations, to development, content creation, design, testing, and launch. By the end, you'll understand the different players and phases and how they fit together in a web design approach focused on meaningful communication and a great user experience.
