Most professionals can't afford full-time proofreaders. With some simple tips and extra attention to detail, you can edit your own writing and make sure it's as polished as possible before you hit send. Learn the five keys to effective editing, from checking content, spelling, and grammar to applying basic formatting. Find out how to apply these rules to emails, presentations, and blog posts—yours or someone else's—and create style guides and templates to be more productive. Instructor Erin Rickard, a writer, professor, and long-time editor, also points out the most frequent mistakes writers make and provides tips for finding and correcting them.
