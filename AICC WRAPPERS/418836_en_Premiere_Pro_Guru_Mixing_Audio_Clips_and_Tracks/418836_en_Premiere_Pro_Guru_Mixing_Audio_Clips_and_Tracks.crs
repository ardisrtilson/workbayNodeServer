Good audio makes for great video, and with Premiere Pro, you can make your audio sound great. In this installment of Premiere Pro Guru, Luisa Winters walks through the process of mixing audio—adjusting levels, adding transitions, and more—and then stepping it up a notch with some commonly used effects, such as EQ, reverb, and de-essing. She also includes tips for changing the length and speed of your audio tracks, recording scratch tracks, and exporting audio separately from video.
