[Course_Description]
Functional programming allows you to write more concise code that's easier to read, debug, and maintain. It revolves around powerful, mathematical functions that tell the computer what to doâ€”not how to do it. The developer doesn't have to worry about order of execution, loops, or conditions. You simply define the desired outcome; the computer takes care of the rest. This course introduces the benefits and features of functional programming, and shows how to use different techniques and libraries in C++ to make code more functional. Instructor Troy Miles reviews built-in functions such as transform, copyif, accumulate, and bind and shows how to convert statements into more functional expressions using C++ Lambda functions. Plus, explore template metaprogramming with C++ templates and the STL and Boost.Hana libraries, and functional reactive programming with the RxCpp Reactive Extensions library for C++.
