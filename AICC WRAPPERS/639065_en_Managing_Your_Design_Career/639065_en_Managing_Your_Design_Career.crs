Are you inspired or tired by your job? Given how much time you spend at work, you deserve to be doing something that lifts you up instead of dragging you down. In this course, Diane Domeyer helps designers and creative professionals pursue a career journey that is both challenging and rewarding. Diane discusses how to determine what you want out of your career-whether it's a promotion or a new role at a different company-and the various steps you can take to get there. She covers finding mentors, participating in cross-departmental initiatives, and working up to a leadership role. She also shares how to change fields or industries, deal with a move to a new city, and use networking to uncover opportunities.
