[Course_Description]
When you're tasked with building an ecommerce site for a client, pricing and scoping your project can require some finesse. If you underprice your project, you have to put in extra hours just to finish it. If you overprice it, you can lose bids and your clients might be upset with what they get. In this course, learn how to effectively scope projects—in particular, ecommerce projects—so that you and your clients are happy with the results. Instructor Patrick Rauland shows how to discuss potential ecommerce projects with clients, and accurately scope and deliver proposals. He walks through the discovery process, explains how to effectively define the project, and discusses how to write and deliver a proposal to win the job.
