[Course_Description]
As teams have become more remote and global, the need for remote collaborative design in the built sector has increased. Revit is a multidisciplinary BIM software that allows multiple professionals and disciplines to collaborate in real-time. With the addition of BIM Collaborate Pro, collaboration can go remote and be expanded across the globe, going well beyond a corporate LAN or intranet. In this course, instructor Onyema Udeze explains the importance of a Common Data Environment (CDE) such as Autodesk Construction Cloud and how it can make your projects more efficient. Onyema shows you how to communicate with remote teams through a work-shared Revit model and goes over the important role that Autodesk Connector plays in managing remote collaboration through Revit. He covers how non-technical stakeholders on a project can make their inputs in the cloud through the Change/Information Management and Model Coordination features of BIM Collaborate Pro.
