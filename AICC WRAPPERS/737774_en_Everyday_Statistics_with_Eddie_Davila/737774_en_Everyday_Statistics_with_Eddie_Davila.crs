Statistics help us make sense of the world around us. These numbers help everyone from political pollsters to fantasy football aficionados make informed calls based on the mountains of data at their disposal. In this weekly series, learn how to decode the statistics that pop up on a daily basis. Eddie Davila explores a new eclectic, real-world topic each week. Learn how stats are used to find the average score on a test, how casinos use stats to ensure that the house will usually win, and more. Note: Because this is an ongoing series, viewers will not receive a certificate of completion.
