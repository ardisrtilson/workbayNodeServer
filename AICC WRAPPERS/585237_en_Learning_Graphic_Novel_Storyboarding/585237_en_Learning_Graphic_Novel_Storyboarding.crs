[Course_Description]
When it comes to conveying a story visually to readers, comic book artists can learn a lot from examining how shots are filmed in movies and television. Although comic book panels aren't always a standard rectangular frame, you can still leverage the same storyboarding concepts, rules, and methods used in film to make your comics stronger and more digestible. In this course, join comic creator Ben Bishop as he explains how to use storyboard film techniques to understand shot composition, consistency, and movement within a frame, and apply those techniques as you build your comic book panels. Before you can start drawing your comic, you need to know the basics of shot composition and camera angles, and why they're crucial to successfully telling your story on the page. Ben talks about the rule of thirds, wide shots, full shots, medium shots, close-ups, and more. He also demonstrates the importance of following the action in the same direction throughout any given scene. Storyboarding may not always be associated with comics, but the same rules apply. Knowing and understanding these concepts can strengthen your work.
