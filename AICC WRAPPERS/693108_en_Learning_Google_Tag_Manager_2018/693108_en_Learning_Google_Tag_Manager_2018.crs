[Course_Description]
Google Tag Manager is a hot technology that allows marketers to use one container for all their web code tags. This, in turn, frees marketers from their dependency on IT or web development departmentsâ€”when they want to add or alter a snippet of analytics or tracking code, they can do it themselves by adding it to the existing tag container. This course shows marketers how to effectively leverage Google Tag Manager. Discover how to best work with accounts and containers, leverage the Google Analytics built-in tags, work with control versions and user access, create custom variables, fire Google Analytics events using triggers, and more. Plus, discover crucial time-saving best practices.
