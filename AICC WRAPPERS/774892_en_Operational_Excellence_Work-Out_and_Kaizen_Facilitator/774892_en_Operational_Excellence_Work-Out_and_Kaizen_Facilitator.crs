[Course_Description]
If you are assigned to lead a Lean Six Sigma Work-Out or Kaizen event in your organization, where do you start? This course provides training on how to prepare, plan, and conduct these intensive working sessions. Dr. Richard Chua—an author, professor, and certified Lean Six Sigma Master Black Belt trainer—explains what a Work-Out or Kaizen event is and how to prepare and plan, including developing the purpose, scope, and detailed agenda; selecting Lean Six Sigma tools; and deciding who to invite. He also shows how to conduct different types of events and follow-up. Sample detailed agendas are provided. Note: This course does not cover general meeting facilitation. It is specific to planning Work-Outs and Kaizen events. Any prerequisite training in the Operational Excellence and Six Sigma learning paths should be completed beforehand.
