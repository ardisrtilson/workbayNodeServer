[Course_Description]
If you’ve ever completed a big project at work, after the initial elation or relief starts to fade, you may have quickly realized that the work is not yet done. While the people involved in the project might be ready to move on to new work, or back to their regular roles, the project deliverables need to transition to operational use. And as Claudine Peet shows in this course, that doesn’t just happen automatically. The transition is a high-risk phase that impacts all stakeholders, and must therefore be carefully planned. Claudine details the many different stages of a transition, including planning and communicating the approach in the pre-transition stage, appointing a transition team, defining transition acceptance criteria, and implementing the actual transition and managing the outcome. She also delves into the post-transition phase, highlighting how to achieve stable operations and measure the effectiveness of the transition.
