[Course_Description]
Modern video editors are often expected to know a little bit of everything. As a result, it's advantageous for editors to get a grasp on other creative skills that could enhance their value in the workplace. In this course, Rich Harrington and Cheryl Ottenritter help editors enhance one such skill—working with audio—by giving an overview of the audio workflow, and sharing practical advice, tips, and techniques for working with audio in Adobe Premiere Pro. They cover how to set up tracks in Premiere Pro, adjust audio levels on the Timeline, use the Clip Mixer and Track Mixer, compress audio, remove noise, do a quality control check of your audio mix with Audition, and more.
