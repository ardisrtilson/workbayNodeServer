[Course_Description]
In this Start to Finish documentary, Scott Pagano, head of LA design studio Neither-Field, walks us through the cinematic, motion-based music video he designed for electronic music group the M Machine. Taking inspiration from Fritz Lang's classic film of the same name, Metropolis Pt. II takes you on a path to the beating heart of a city, punctuated by moments that rise and fall with the music. Scott explains how he constructed the buildings using Maya's particle system, designed the mechanical vines that guide the viewer along, and built the mechanized human figure at the city's center, which explodes to reveal its own inner workings.
