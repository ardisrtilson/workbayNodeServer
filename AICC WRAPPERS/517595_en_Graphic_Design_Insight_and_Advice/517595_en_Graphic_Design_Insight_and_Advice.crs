[Course_Description]
Get insights, advice, and inspiration from a master designer. John McWade offers advice on general but key topics for new designers just starting out: choosing the right typeface, finding inspiration, setting up a color palette, keeping your work fresh, knowing when a design is not working, and more. We also get a peek into how he got his start, which is an interesting look at the birth of desktop publishing.
