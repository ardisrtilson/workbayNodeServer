[Course_Description]
As a professional, your job is to deliver results: to identify what needs to be accomplished and get it done. It's what separates high potentials and high performers from the rest. In this course, leadership expert Dave Crenshaw shares a simple formula for delivering resultsâ€”setting up systems and habits that reinforce your goals and adding personal accountability to reinforce your efforts. He explains how to tap into your underlying motivation, which makes it easier to keep on track. He also provides real-life examples that show you the process in action and inspire you to do the same. While delivering results may be simple, it is often the hardest part of anyone's job. Learn how to tame your disorganization, frustration, and any other blockers in your way and get to work.
