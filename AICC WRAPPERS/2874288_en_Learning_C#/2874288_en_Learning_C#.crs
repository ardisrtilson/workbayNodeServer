Whether it’s running on the cloud, to desktops with MacOS and Linux, to mobile operating systems like Android and iOS, C# has grown into a mature, powerful language for almost any programming purpose. In this course, Joe Marini dives into the fundamentals of C#, starting with a basic overview of language constructs like program flow and data types. He then gets into more advance topics such as functions, object-oriented programming techniques, and string processing.
