[Course_Description]
Simply put, grids are an essential design tool for containing and organizing type and images. But they do so much more. Grids give compositions strength and structure. Grids help break space into units. And grids streamline the visual design process. Designer Ina Saltz walks you through how to use grids effectively in both print and screen-based projects, offering examples from websites, books, magazines, and even comic strips. Ina touches on using grids to solve issues with hierarchy, proportion, and variation, and points out occasions that might warrant breaking away from the grid, to give your compositions more visual tension and interest. Start here and learn how to add this powerful tool to your typographic arsenal.
