[Course_Description]
The objective of management is to make improvementsâ€”not only to products and services but also to entire processes. The difficult thing is to know what needs improving, and then whether your interventions have made a positive difference. This course provides an overview of the basic tools used for process improvement, such as statistical process control, and how to use these tools to improve the three most critical aspects of your business process: time, quality, and cost. Chris Croft distills the best practices from process improvement frameworks such as Lean and Six Sigma, and combines them into lessons that will help take the core of what your business does, measure it, and do it better.
