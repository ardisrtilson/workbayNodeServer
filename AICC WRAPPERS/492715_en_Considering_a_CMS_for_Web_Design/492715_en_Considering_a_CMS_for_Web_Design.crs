[Course_Description]
Web designers—whether freelance or working within an organization—appreciate simple and flexible technology that can be customized and updated quickly to suit the evolving needs of their client or company. Content management systems (CMSs) come with many benefits, such as allowing non-technical users to change the design easily without reliance on developers. Additionally, CMSs are a current technology, meaning many are responsive, mobile-friendly, optimized for search engines, and up-to-date. So, how do you choose the right one for your needs? This course compares different hosted CMS services available today. A CMS design process is discussed to illustrate how to handle unique challenges that can occur depending on the selection you make. Tips both specific to hosted CMSs and for design in general are presented. These tips range from picking the right template and optimizing the images you choose, to choosing compelling imagery.
