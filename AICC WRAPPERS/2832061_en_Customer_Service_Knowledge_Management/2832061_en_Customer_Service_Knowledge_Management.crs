[Course_Description]
Every service organization needs a knowledge base (KB) to shorten resolution time, reduce customer effort, and drive self-service. In this course, instructor David Kay shows you how to keep yours up to date with easily findable and usable information. David explains what knowledge management (KM) is and what problems it can solve within service organizations. He helps you assess the current state of your knowledge programs, so you can focus on where to improve. David introduces knowledge-centered service (KCS®), an agile approach that captures, structures, and reuses knowledge in the service delivery workflow. Knowledge becomes part of everyone's job, rather than extra work. David discusses how to ensure knowledge quality and measure your program’s health and business benefits. He offers specific techniques for driving change and putting KCS into practice.
