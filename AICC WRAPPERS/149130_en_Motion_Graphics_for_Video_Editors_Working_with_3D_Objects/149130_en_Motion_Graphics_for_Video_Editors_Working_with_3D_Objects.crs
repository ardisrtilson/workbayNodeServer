[Course_Description]
As a video editor, you might not create 3D objects, but you should still know how to work with them. If you are not quite comfortable with 3D, this course is for you, providing a lightweight introduction to the skills required to create and manipulate 3D graphics specifically for video. Rich Harrington shows how to use Photoshop to texture, light, recolor, reposition, and format 3D objects for use in video projects. He also shows how to use the Vanishing Point Exchange workflow to move objects from Photoshop to After Effects, plus how to enhance and render a model in After Effects and create simple 3D objects from scratch in Illustrator. At the end of the course, Rich shows how to hand off your files to a nonlinear editor like Premiere Pro.
