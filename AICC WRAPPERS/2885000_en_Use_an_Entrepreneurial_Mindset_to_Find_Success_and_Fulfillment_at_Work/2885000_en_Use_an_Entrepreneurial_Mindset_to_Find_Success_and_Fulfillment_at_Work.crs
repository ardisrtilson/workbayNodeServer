So often, our measure of success comes from someone or somewhere else. Entrepreneurial thinking can help you define success on your own terms. In this course, organizational psychologist Erin Shrimpton shows how to adopt a mindset to find success and fulfillment at work. As Erin explains, entrepreneurial thinking isnâ€™t just for startups. Taking calculated risks, seeing opportunity in adversity, and acting decisively in a crisis are all routes to success for any employee. She shows the way entrepreneurs think, act, and thrive, and how to harness these skills to find success and fulfillment in what you do.
