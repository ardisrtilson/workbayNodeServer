[Course_Description]
DevOps engineer is one of the most in-demand tech jobs on the market. But since this role is still relatively new, aspiring DevOps engineers may have a somewhat murky understanding of what the position entails. In this course, Laura Stone clearly outlines what's expected of DevOps practitioners, as well as what it takes to become a DevOps engineer (and how to excel once you've landed the job). She begins by highlighting the basic qualifications and training needed to land a job as a DevOps practitioner. Next, she provides a technical roadmap for the skills needed to gain an entry-level role in DevOps; shares tips from a DevOps recruiter; and provides steps for measuring progress and achieving your goals throughout your DevOps career.
