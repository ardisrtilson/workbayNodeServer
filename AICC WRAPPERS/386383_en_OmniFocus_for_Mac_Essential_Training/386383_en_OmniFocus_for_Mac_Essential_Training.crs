[Course_Description]
Learn how to supercharge productivity and master the intricacies of OmniFocus, the popular task manager for Mac OS X. Author David Sparks explores OmniFocus conventions and the app interface, and then dives into capturing tasks in a variety of ways, including writing tasks manually, using Mail Drop to import tasks, harnessing the OmniFocus Clip-o-Tron, and using keyboard shortcuts to speed up data entry. The course then explains how to best process tasks: setting up projects, establishing contexts and repeating tasks, and using such important features as date deferral, flags, perspectives, and the Forecast view. The course wraps up with a look at acting on and reviewing tasks and projects.
