[Course_Description]
Challenging political discussions can impact team cohesion within an organization. When emotions are running high, people struggle to balance their desire to express themselves with the desire to maintain functional relationships. What should they say? How should they say it? In this audio-only course, negotiation and conflict resolution expert Kwame Christian shares steps you can take to structure and navigate political conversations in the workplace. Kwame references Jonathan Haidtâ€™s Moral Foundations Theory to help you better understand key political ideologies (and where they stem from.) He also shares strategies for managing emotional conversations about politics, including how to mobilize empathy and lean into joint problem-solving.
