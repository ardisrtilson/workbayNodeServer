[Course_Description]
Coaching involves much more than just talking to people; it requires posing intelligent questions that inspire your employees to talk about their thoughts, their work, and their concerns. In his book The Coaching Habit, Michael Bungay Stanier—the first person honored as Coach of the Year in Canada—uses the construct of seven essential coaching questions to teach managers how to coach effectively. This audio-only summary of his book, produced by getAbstract, provides valuable coaching techniques that can help leaders empower their employees and avoid common coaching pitfalls. This audiobook summary was created by getAbstract, the world’s largest provider of business book summaries. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
