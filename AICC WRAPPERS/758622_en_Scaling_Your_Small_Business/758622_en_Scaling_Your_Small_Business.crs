Take your business to the next level. Many entrepreneurs and small business owners find it difficult to make the transition from startup to mature company. But if you want to make your big idea even bigger, it's critical to shift your mindset. You need to define what you do best, communicate it to customers, and outsource any nonessential tasks. In this course, John Jantsch explains how to scale a startup into a successful business that is prepared for future growth. Learn why it's important to understand and periodically re-evaluate who your customers are and why they value your product or service. Discover how to communicate your unique brand promise, use the most potent marketing channels, and collaborate with strategic, implementation, and co-marketing partners. John also helps you delegate tasks and turn your focus to what matters: demonstrating leadership and innovation. Plus, get valuable tips on measuring your success and hiring the right people.
