[Course_Description]
Good leaders are rare. Why? Because there’s a common misconception that leadership is an innate quality and that it’s about dominating and directing others. Good leadership, in fact, is a collaborative learning process. Yes, you’re responsible for the galvanizing vision and for keeping the team focused and motivated, but most of the work is about delegating, listening, managing stress, and adapting. This course offers proven frameworks for thinking about leadership and strategies for training yourself to lead more effectively—throughout your career. Leaders and executives such as Robert S. Kaplan and Stephen Miles explain how to identify your leadership style, identify areas for growth, communicate a vision, prioritize, effectively manage stress, and learn from failure. This course includes videos from: Dan Pontefract, author and chief envisioner at TELUS Robert S. Kaplan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Stephen Miles, founder and CEO of The Miles Group Kelly McGonigal, health psychologist and author Alisa Cohn, executive coach Note: This course was produced by Big Think.
