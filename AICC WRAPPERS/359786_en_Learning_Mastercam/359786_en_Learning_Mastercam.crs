[Course_Description]
Computer numerical control (CNC) milling is a subtractive process that allows you to carve digital 3D models out of blocks of solid material like foam, wood, plastic, or metal. Computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) programs are used to control CNC mills, which can fabricate objects that are often stronger than those created by additive meansâ€”for example, 3D printing. In this short course, Taylor Hokanson helps you get up and running with Mastercam, one of the most popular CAD/CAM applications. He demonstrates how to use this program to create basic geometry and convert it to toolpaths for export to the mill of your choice.
