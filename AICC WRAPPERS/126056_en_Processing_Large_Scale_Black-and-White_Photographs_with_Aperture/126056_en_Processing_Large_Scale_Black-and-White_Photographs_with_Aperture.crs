[Course_Description]
Watch artist Joseph Linaschke explain the creation of his gallery hanging of large black-and-white prints on metal and discuss the many challenges he faced along the way. He backward-engineers his process in Aperture for us, showing how he reviews his images, crops and straightens them in preparation for conversion, scales them without introducing any loss in quality, and then makes the final adjustment to black and white. Finally, learn about the file output and setup that went into the final set of prints.
