[Course_Description]
Start making music with the powerful, intuitive controls in Studio One and these lessons from producer and remixer Josh Harris. Josh begins with a tour of Studio One's Start Page, the creative hub of the program, where you set up your artist profile and audio devices. He then shows you how to set up and start recording a new song, including punching in and using track layers. The course then moves into editing audio and MIDI, where Josh explains the most important of the editing functions: comping, trimming and time stretching audio, quantizing MIDI, and editing MIDI velocities. He also covers mixing with effects and chains, showing how to speed up the process with presets and automation, and explores Studio One's unique feature set used to master your recordings. The course wraps with tips to connect with your audience and share your music with the world, including publishing to SoundCloud, promoting songs on the Nimbit Store, and using PreSonus Exchange.
