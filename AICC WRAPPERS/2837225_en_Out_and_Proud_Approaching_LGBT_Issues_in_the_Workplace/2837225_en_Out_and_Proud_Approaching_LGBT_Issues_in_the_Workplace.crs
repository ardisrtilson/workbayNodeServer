Attracting and maintaining a diverse workforce offers a slew of benefits to organizations. It boosts innovation and problem-solving by providing access to an array of experiences and ideas, helps ensure that more workers feel that they belong, and more. In this course, instructor Jacqui Lloyd lays out why diversity and inclusion matters for businesses, how professionals who identify as LGBT can feel more confident about coming out at work, and how allies can help create a more inclusive work environment. Using her own experiences as a visible and proud out gay woman, Jacqui explains how coming out can help you personally and professionally. Plus, learn why, regardless of your sexual orientation, it's important to be aware of the role you can play as an ally in supporting your LGBT colleagues.
