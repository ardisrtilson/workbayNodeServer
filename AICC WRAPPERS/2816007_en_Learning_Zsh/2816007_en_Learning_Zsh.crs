[Course_Description]
The Z-Shell, or Zsh, is a powerful shell that helps you get your command-line tasks done quickly and effectively. It’s widely available and is the new default shell on macOS. While Zsh is largely compatible with Bash, it offers many useful features—from history recall to spell-check—that can enhance your workflow. In this course, discover how Zsh works, how to configure it, and how to extend it with plugins. Instructor Scott Simpson goes over the many capabilities of Zsh, highlighting functionality that Zsh offers that other shells may not.
