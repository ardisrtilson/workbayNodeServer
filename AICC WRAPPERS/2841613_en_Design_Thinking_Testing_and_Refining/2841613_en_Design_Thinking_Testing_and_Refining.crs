[Course_Description]
Testing a design results in valuable insights because it reveals what hinders and what helps the user, so you know what features to keep, which designs to modify, and which parts to scrap altogether. This course focuses on the testing phase of the five-step design thinking process. After briefly reviewing previous steps, learn about testing and how to refine your testing purpose. Learn how to find the right methods and strategies for your testing, then dive into how to determine if your testing is successful—and what to do if it’s not. See how to maximize what you gather from your testing, including velocity and conversion. Then, discover how to use testing to get bigger, better results from your ideas. Put what you’ve learned together to create a robust team testing strategy.
