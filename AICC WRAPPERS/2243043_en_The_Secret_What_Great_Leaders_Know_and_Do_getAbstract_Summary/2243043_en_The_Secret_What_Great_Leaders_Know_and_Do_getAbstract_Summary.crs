[Course_Description]
With over 20 million books in print, One-Minute Manager author Ken Blanchard is one of the world’s most popular business authors. The Secret: What Great Leaders Know and Do is an inspirational business novel he wrote with Mark Miller, training and development vice president of the Chick-fil-A restaurant chain. This audiobook from getAbstract summarizes the biggest lessons from The Secret—the fictional, motivational story of Debbie Brewster, a new manager for a corporate client services division. Her business unit is the company’s worst and she’s failing miserably as a leader. She worries that she will lose her job—until the firm’s president becomes her mentor and gives her a crash course on leadership. getAbstract recommends this short, nicely written parable on the meaning of leadership. This audiobook summary was created by getAbstract, the world’s largest provider of business book summaries. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
