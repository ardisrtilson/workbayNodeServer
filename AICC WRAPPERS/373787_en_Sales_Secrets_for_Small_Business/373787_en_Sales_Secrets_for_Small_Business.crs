Small business consultant Dave Crenshaw offers a simple three-step sales system (explore-present-act) that you can incorporate into your own small business to boost sales. First, learn the seven foundations of small business sales: common-sense techniques such as asking questions, listening, and following up. Then get tips to start building your sales system. Dave shows that by (1) getting to know the prospects and their needs better, you can (2) provide a brief presentation that focuses on their needs and (3) follow up to determine next steps and encourage them to act. Dave also provides sample sales scripts you can use for each stage of the process, as well as suggestions to create your own scripts. To keep your sales going strong far into the future, make sure you check out the closing chapters on practicing and measuring your progress and evolving your sales system.
