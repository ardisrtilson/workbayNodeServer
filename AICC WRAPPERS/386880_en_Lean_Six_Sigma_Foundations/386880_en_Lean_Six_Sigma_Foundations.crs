[Course_Description]
Lean Six Sigma combines the principles of lean enterprise and lean manufacturing with Six Sigma to improve performance and systematically remove waste. Supply chain expert and professor Steven Brown explains the basics of using Lean Six Sigma as a structure for your improvement efforts. Steven outlines the process stages in Six Sigma (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control), along with the Lean toolkit: the 5s principles, kanban (scheduling), downtime, poka-yoke (error proofing), and kaizen (continuous improvement). He also explains how leadership works within Lean Six Sigma, the principles of project execution, and how Lean Six Sigma is applied to the service sector and supply chain management.
