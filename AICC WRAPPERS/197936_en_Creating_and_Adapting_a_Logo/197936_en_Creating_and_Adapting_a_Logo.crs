[Course_Description]
Learn how to create an eye-catching logo from scratch and adapt it to fit a variety of applications: from business cards to banner ads. Join Deke as he works with art director Danielle Fritz on a logo concept for Frontiers Unlimited (a space tourism company with big ambitions!) and then as he vectorizes the design using Illustrator and Photoshop. He'll take you through every step in the process, from identifying the brand's objectives to creating the base artwork, adding typography, assigning spot colors for print, adding device-independent color and shading, and integrating some intriguing touches of photorealism. Lastly, he'll show how to change the orientation of the graphic so that it can work in many different layouts. In the end, you'll have a memorable logo that communicates your brand's personal or corporate values in a single glance.
