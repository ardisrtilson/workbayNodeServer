[Course_Description]
Successful persuasion can seem like a matter of charisma, luck, or timing, but neuroscience reveals that there are reliable, successful approaches to persuasion that can be used by anyone. In this course, you’ll learn about the science behind persuasion, and explore how to develop more effective marketing and sales messages using the pain-claim-gain framework. Author Patrick Renvoise starts by explaining the dual nature of the human brain—rational and primal—and shares why most sales and marketing messages fail. He then reveals a step-by-step process to stimulate the primal brain of your audience. Patrick’s scientific approach to selling has helped many people become more effective at persuasion and close more sales.
