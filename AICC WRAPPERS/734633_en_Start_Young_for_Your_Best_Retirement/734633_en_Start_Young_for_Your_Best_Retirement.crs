[Course_Description]
The concept of retirement strikes many as being too far away, not urgent, or not realistic. For the millennials who haven't started saving for retirement, as well as the Gen Xers with $70K or less stashed away in retirement funds, the prospect of retirement can even feel unattainable. But it doesn't have to be this way. This course was designed to help you organize your finances and craft a plan that ensures that—whatever your retirement goals might be—you'll have the cash you need for your third act. Jane Barratt demystifies financial jargon, defrays some of the fears around retirement, and shares practical advice to help you start building your financial plan. Learn how to look at real estate with an investor mindset, what to expect when you work with financial professionals, and more. DISCLAIMER: The advice information provided in this course is general advice only. It has been prepared without taking into account your objectives, financial situation, or risk tolerance. The course is not intended to give investment advice, but instead to communicate basic information to help viewers understand the basics of the topic presented. For investment advice, you should seek advice guidance from your own trusted independent financial advisor.
