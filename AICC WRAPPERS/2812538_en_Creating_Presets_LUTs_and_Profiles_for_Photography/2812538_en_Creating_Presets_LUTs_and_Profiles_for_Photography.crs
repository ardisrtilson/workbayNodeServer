Are you looking to save time and unlock new creative options in your photo editing workflow? Learn how to build custom presets, LUTs, and profiles in popular photo editing applications such as Photoshop, Lightroom, Camera Raw, Capture One, and Nik. Instructor Rich Harrington shows how to save your favorite adjustments as presets so you can use them again and again. Then he shows how to create lookup tables (LUTs) to make consistent, creative color adjustments. Finally, explore advanced options for creating lens correction profiles for any lens and camera combination, and use DNG camera profiles to calibrate your software. Once built, your new presets, LUTs, and profiles will become go-to tools, saving valuable time and providing a one-click, signature look for your photographs.
