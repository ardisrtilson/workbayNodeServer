[Course_Description]
Turning contacts into quality relationships takes effort. It's not enough to connect on LinkedIn or to follow a person's journey on Facebook or Instagram. You need to invest in relationships to strengthen and grow them over time. In this course, Skyler Logsdon—a young, well-connected, and wildly ambitious tech entrepreneur—reveals the strategies that have helped him land the opportunities, experiences, and friendships he's thankful for today. Discover the difference between relationship building and networking, and the four qualities you need to build strong connections: effort, courage, perseverance, and authenticity. Plus, find out how mentoring—and being mentored—can help you take the next step in your career.
