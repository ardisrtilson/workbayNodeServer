[Course_Description]
SketchUp is a great tool for quickly visualizing an interior design project. Ed Cotey shows you how to develop a floor plan quickly, using an imported AutoCAD file and a number of SketchUp tools to build the walls, insert doors and windows, create and use materials, and apply special effects such as styles and shadows. Plus, learn to set up scenes for use in client presentations.
