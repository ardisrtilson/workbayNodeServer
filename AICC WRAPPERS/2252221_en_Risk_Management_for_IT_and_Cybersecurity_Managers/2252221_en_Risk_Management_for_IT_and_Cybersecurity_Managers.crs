[Course_Description]
Curious about why leaders at your organization decided not to fund your project? In this course, get an inside look at how cybersecurity and information technology (IT) managers use a preliminary risk analysis to determine which projects to pass on and which ones to support with funding. Instructor Jason Dion goes over the terms used by executives and managers when discussing risk management, including what it means to mitigate, transfer, avoid, and accept risk. He also digs into the two methods you can use to calculate risk: qualitative and quantitative risk measurement. To lend these concepts a real-world context, Jason dives into a case study. Upon wrapping up this course, you'll have the knowledge you need to build a more compelling business case for your projects.
