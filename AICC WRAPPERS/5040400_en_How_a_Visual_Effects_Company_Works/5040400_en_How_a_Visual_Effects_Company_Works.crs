[Course_Description]
In the real world, visual effects is a collaborative process. It takes a lot of people and a lot of talent to create what the audience sees on screen. Knowing the software is only half the job. If you’re trying to find your place in VFX, it's helpful to know what goes on inside a real production at a real company. This course fills the gap between theory and practice, by explaining exactly how visual effects fit into the bigger filmmaking process, how decisions are made, what the VFX team does, and who participates in the review process where shots are approved—and important changes are made. Conrad Olson—a senior VFX compositor for Hollywood films such as Spider-Man and Harry Potter—gives you an inside look at the industry.
