Cinema 4D is an essential tool for aspiring motion graphics artists and designers alike. With Cinema 4D, you can enhance your motion graphics, models, and visualizations with 3D objects, dynamic effects, and animation. This course reviews the basics of Cinema 4D R21, covering the interface, the tools, and the hierarchyâ€”the key to grasping everything in C4D. Instructor Andy Needham introduces you to C4D materials, lights, and cameras, as well as techniques such as compositing, animation, and rendering. The final chapter takes you from start to finish through a complete project: creating a professional-looking 3D animated logo. This course was created by Andy Needham. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
