[Course_Description]
The word kaizen means to change for the better. It is people-centered, scientific problem-solving, directed towards the benefit of society. Creating a strong culture of kaizen—focused on people, not processes—is a fundamental aspect of continuous improvement success. This course explores the human side of lean in great detail. Learn about the difference between so-called adaptive and non-adaptive cultures. Discover the importance of habits and find out how to mitigate social threats. Plus, explore the characteristics of a successful kaizen leader, and learn motivation and persuasion techniques to improve your communication skills and positively influence your team. This course was created by Gemba Academy, a leading provider of lean and Six Sigma training. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
