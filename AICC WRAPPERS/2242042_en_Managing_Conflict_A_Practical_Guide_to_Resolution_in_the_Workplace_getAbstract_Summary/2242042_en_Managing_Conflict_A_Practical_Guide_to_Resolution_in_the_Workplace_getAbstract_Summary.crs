[Course_Description]
Most companies default to outdated and process-heavy approaches to conflict management. Learn how to unlock the benefits of conflict in this audio-only review of David Liddle’s book. Liddle says conflict is inevitable and can affect your whole workforce, so leaders should prepare by instituting more effective resolution policies. He offers a comprehensive overview for managing institutional conflict. Though he deals primarily with British firms, he’s added enough detail from other countries to serve a broader audience. This audio-only review from getAbstract pulls the most relevant insights from this heavily researched book. This audiobook summary was created by getAbstract, the world’s largest provider of business book summaries. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
