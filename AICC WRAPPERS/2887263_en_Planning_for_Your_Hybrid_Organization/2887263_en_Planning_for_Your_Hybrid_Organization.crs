[Course_Description]
We have learned that remote work is viable, but perhaps that isn’t your long-term future. If you also aren’t sure that bringing everyone back to the office is preferred, you are left to look at hybrid work models. Chances are that some type of hybrid work model is in your future—but what will it look like and how will you get there? In this course, instructor Kevin Eikenberry outlines six different hybrid work models and shows you how to determine which type of remote work model will be best for you. Kevin helps you determine how to build a plan that gains the acceptance and commitment of your organization. Plus, he shares tips designed to help organizations successfully transition to hybrid work, including how to set up your leaders and team members for success.
