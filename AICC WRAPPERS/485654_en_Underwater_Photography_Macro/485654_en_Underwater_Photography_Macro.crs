Capture the close-up beauty of fish, coral, and all manner of undersea wonders with this guide to underwater macro photography. In this course, Photoshop guru Deke McClelland is joined by master diver and professional underwater photographer Hergen Spalink to explore techniques, concepts, and gear involved in underwater macro photography. Deke and Hergen explain what macro is and which lenses you'll need to start shooting the sea's tiniest creatures. They also walk through exposure, key lighting, fill lighting, the strobe distance rule, composition, and post processing. Plus, they cover special techniques such as capturing natural fluorescence in underwater creatures.
