[Course_Description]
Working with green-screen footage can be a daunting task. The Adobe suite of video tools provides a wide array of choices, but how do you know which to use? This course aims to answer that important question. Instructor Rich Harrington guides you through the keying process in Premiere Pro, After Effects, and popular third-party keying tools. Get an overview of the import process, and discover the strengths of each keyer. Learn how to use Ultra Keyer, KEYLIGHT, Red Giant Keying Suite (including the Primatte Keyer), and Light Wrap Fantastic, while discovering ways to work with transparency and create great backdrops in Photoshop.
