[Course_Description]
Love your drone, but find the data it produces too unwieldy to process on your personal computer? Let Autodesk ReCap Pro do the heavy lifting. ReCap lets you convert images captured from drones into seamless photos, 3D models, and point clouds. You simply upload the drone data to the cloud, and you'll get an email when files are complete and ready for download. Learn how to use ReCap Pro in this fun and fast-paced training course from GIS consultant Gordon Luckett. Discover how to upload imagery and aerial photos to ReCap and process the data so it can be used in other applications, such as InfraWorks and AutoCAD Civil 3D.
