[Course_Description]
Premiere Pro 2020 is here. Adobe has dropped “CC” from the name and replaced it with some exciting performance and feature enhancements. Learn all about the new features in the latest version of this premiere editing program. Author Rich Harrington starts with the new camera support and export options, which make it easier to work with a wider range of devices and file formats. Then learn how to intelligently reframe footage with the AI-powered Auto Reframe effect, and leverage other editing improvements such as increased audio range and temporal and spatial interpolation on keyframes. Rich also reviews the enhancements to the Essential Graphics panel—the new home of motion graphic templates (MOGRTS)—for text formatting and layer management.
