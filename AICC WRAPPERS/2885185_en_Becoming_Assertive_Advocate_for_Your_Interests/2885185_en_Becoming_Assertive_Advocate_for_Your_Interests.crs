[Course_Description]
Authentic assertiveness is about more than just speaking powerfully and confidently. In this course, instructor TJ Guttormsen explains some fundamentals of communication and equips you with practical strategies to start and build conversations that are more likely to get the results you want. TJ discusses speech, eye contact, and body language, as well as the importance of being succinct. He presents ways to stand out from the crowd when it’s the right thing to do, then goes over maintaining a calm and respectful demeanor to be assertive with authority figures and more. In group settings, it’s easy for less assertive people to get lost in the crowd. TJ teaches you how and when to speak up. He covers several assertive habits and techniques to help you communicate effectively, get help and support, and say no when needed. TJ concludes with action steps to help you practice being more assertive in ways that will improve your life. Note: This course was created by TJ Guttormsen.
