[Course_Description]
Good inclusive marketing reaches an audience where they are. And it’s crafted by people who take the time to understand who their audience is and what they actually want. When marketing campaigns come across as tone-deaf, it’s often because the campaign’s creators leaned on their assumptions instead of investigating the nuances of their target market. In this course, instructor Jonathan Jackson shares strategies for checking your assumptions at the door and reaching diverse audiences with organic, inclusive marketing messages. Get insights on how to create tailored messaging, as well as how to build an inclusive community for—and by—diverse audiences. Plus, hear from a panel of experts on why diverse marketing should be a critical part of your marketing strategy today and into the future.
