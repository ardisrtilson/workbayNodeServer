Advance your Rhino modeling and workflow skills. Get the most out of your 3D models and have more fun designing. This course is an ever-growing collection of tips and tricks designed especially for Rhino 6 users. Expert Dave Schultze shares his curve-based approach to Rhino, which combines a small set of commands with straight-forward editing techniques, leading to higher-quality models in less time. He introduces methods for creating rounded forms, fake openings, wrapping recesses, and symmetrical knobs, including challenges along the way to test your new skills. This course was created by Dave Schultze. We are pleased to offer this training in our library. Note: Because this is an ongoing series, viewers will not receive a certificate of completion.
