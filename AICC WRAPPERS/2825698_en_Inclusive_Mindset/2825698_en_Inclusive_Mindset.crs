[Course_Description]
Creating an inclusive environment is not a passive act. Rather, it is a skill that can be learned and improved upon with humility, bravery, and dedication. Inclusive communicators are better able to recruit, retain talent, navigate conflict, and develop buy-in in their work environment. In this course, learn about the importance of fostering an inclusive mindset in the workplace and how to implement beneficial changes in your organization. Examine the research about the critical roles that diversity and belonging play in business. Find out how to cultivate spaces that are safe by acknowledging common challenges that can come from privilege, mistakes, ignorance, or insensitivity. Discover how to promote allyship. Dereca Blackmon covers each of these areas to help you grow as an individual and to help you support others.
