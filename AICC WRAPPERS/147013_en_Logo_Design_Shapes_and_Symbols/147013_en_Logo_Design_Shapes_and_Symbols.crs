[Course_Description]
Storytellers weave their tales with words. Designers must do it with pictures, and shapes and symbols are their visual shorthand, a way of quickly communicating emotion and meaning. Here Bill Gardner, founder of LogoLounge, examines how shapes and symbols help designers integrate story into their logo designs and explores the mystery behind these forms. Learn why people respond emotionally to certain geometric shapes, the history behind common symbols, and new and emerging symbols that will help your logo age gracefully. This course will give you the tools to convey the meaning behind your designs to your clients.
