What makes certain leaders so effective in rallying their troops? In his 2014 book, Leaders Eat Last, Simon Sinek examines the role that our biology plays in the division of leaders and followers, and highlights the qualities that make up a good leader. This audiobook summary contains clips that showcase some of the book's most important points. Learn about the results of bad leadership, how our modern addictions can keep us from building real foundations with other people, how to fulfill your vision for the future by putting others before yourself, and more.
