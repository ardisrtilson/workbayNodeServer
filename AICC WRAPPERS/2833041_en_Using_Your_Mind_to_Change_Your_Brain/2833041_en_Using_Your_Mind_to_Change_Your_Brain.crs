[Course_Description]
The structure of your brain changes constantly in a dynamic, unfolding process that you yourself can help direct to create the life you want. This course shows you how to strengthen the neural circuits that generate happiness, love, and inner peace. Neuropsychologist Rick Hanson, PhD, and neurologist Richard Mendius, MD, share fascinating insights about your brain and how you can consciously affect it with good results. Hanson and Mendius draw on a vast body of research spanning more than 30 years to explain how meditation can rewire the neural pathways in your brain, explore the science behind suffering, and reveal which areas of the brain are responsible for our different skills and emotions. This course was created by Sounds True. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
