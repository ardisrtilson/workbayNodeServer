In this course, Gabriel Corbett teaches you how to build ready-to-manufacture parts and assemblies as well as detailed drawings and itemized bills of materials in SOLIDWORKS 2021.

Find out how to make cuts and create standard holes, and explore more advanced modeling techniques using blocks, mirroring, and the SOLIDWORKS pattern tools. Then review best practices for putting parts together in assemblies and creating detailed drawings.
