[Course_Description]
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is the heart of dynamic IP addressing, and a fundamental concept for any network administrator. This course explains how DHCP works in the context of a Windows environment, and how to manage, secure, and troubleshoot DHCP on Windows Server 2016. Ed Liberman shows how to install the DHCP server role; configure settings such as scopes, clients, and reservations; and advanced features, including DHCP failover and working in a routed environment.
