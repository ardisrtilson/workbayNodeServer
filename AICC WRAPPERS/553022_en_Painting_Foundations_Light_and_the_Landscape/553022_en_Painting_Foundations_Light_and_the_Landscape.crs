[Course_Description]
Capturing the subtleties of a beautifully lit skyline in a painting requires an understanding of certain foundational concepts. In this course, learn key techniques for tackling light and color harmony within acrylic landscapes by completing a large, impressionistic studio painting of a skyline in Venice, Italy. Instructor Will Kemp kicks off the course by diving into the different qualities of lighting within a landscape, explaining how the evening light affects the color temperature of a scene. Will also covers some basics for working with acrylic paint, and reviews the different brushes and materials you'll need for this painting. Plus, he goes into adding texture to the surface of your canvas, mixing pastel base colors, loosening your brushstrokes, and accurately capturing architecture in your drawings.
