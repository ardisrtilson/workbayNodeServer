[Course_Description]
Soccer is one of the most popular international sports. Events like the World Cup keep every country glued to their screens. But how do you properly capture the fasting-moving action of soccer in still images? In this course, award-winning photographer Kevin Steele shares insights on documenting the intensity of soccer action. Operating as if he were on a commercial assignment, Kevin takes you on set and behind the scenes. He'll show how to scout a location, coordinate the athletes, plan your gear, work with both natural light and studio strobes, and make shooting decisions on the spur of the moment. Plus, after the shoot is over, he takes you back to the computer to show how to evaluate and enhance the best shots with Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop.
