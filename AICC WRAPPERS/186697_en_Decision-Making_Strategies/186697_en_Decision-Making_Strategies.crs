[Course_Description]
Learn the art and science of business decision-making from leadership trainer and coach Mike Figliuolo. Mike outlines the four styles of decision making—autocratic, participatory, democratic, and consensual—and reveals which styles are best suited for specific situations. Recognizing that ambiguity is a part of any decision-making process, Mike covers the four types of ambiguity you'll face so that you can recognize what you don't know in order to reduce risk and plan for contingencies. He also presents techniques for involving stakeholders in the decision-making process, and explains how to use a RACI (responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed) matrix. By applying these major concepts, you'll have the tools to help you make better decisions faster, incur less risk, and gain more support for your decisions.
