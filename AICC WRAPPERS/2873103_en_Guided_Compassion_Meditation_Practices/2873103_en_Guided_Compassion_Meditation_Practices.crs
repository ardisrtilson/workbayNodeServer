[Course_Description]
In this course, Kelly McGonigal guides you through four different reflection practices you can use to add a sense of peace and calm to your life. In designing these practices, Kelly used her experience teaching compassion meditations from the Buddhist tradition and combined it with elements drawn from the science of compassion. Each meditation is between 10â€“20 minutes long and can be practiced individually, or combined to create a longer, guided practice that will take you through each step of strengthening compassion for yourself and others. Each meditation can be practiced as a whole or used as on-the-spot short practices in a less formal way than a guided meditation. You can practice the meditations in a chair, on the floor, lying on your back, or walking mindfully outdoors. Experiment, and see what suits you. This course was created by Sounds True. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
