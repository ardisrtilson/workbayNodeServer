[Course_Description]
Unlocking Creativity is a guide to unleashing creativity in the workplace. Starting with the premise that all people are innately creative, this book argues that the best way to unlock employee creativity isnâ€™t to hire all-star creatives or restructure your businesses. Instead, the key is to dismantle the workplace mindsets that are stifling the creativity of the people already in your midst. In this audio-only summary from Blinkist, you can quickly find out how to develop an iterative mindset, prioritize quality, and encourage creativity along with psychological safety. Plus, learn the importance of taking breaks and creative risks. Note: This audiobook summary was produced by Blinkist. We are pleased to host this content in our library.
