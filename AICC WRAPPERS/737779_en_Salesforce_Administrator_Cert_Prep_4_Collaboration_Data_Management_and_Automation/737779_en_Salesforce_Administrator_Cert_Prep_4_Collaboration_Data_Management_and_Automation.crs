[Course_Description]
Become a Salesforce Certified Administrator. This certification can help Salesforce developers, administrators, architects, and sales professionals jump-start their careers and deepen their understanding of the platform. To help you prepare for the exam, instructor Mike Wheeler has designed the Salesforce Administrator Cert Prep series, which covers all the core objectives in detail. In this course—the fourth installment in the series—he reviews the collaboration, data management, and automation features. Learn how tasks and events work and how to enable Chatter, the collaboration component of Salesforce. Then find out how to import, validate, and back up the data you store in Salesforce. Finally, discover how to automate common processes—such as approvals—with workflow rules and actions, and use the Lightning Process Builder for more advanced automation actions, such as creating new objects and updating fields across objects.
