[Course_Description]
Great icons are simple, evocative, and communicative. That said, the workflow behind these simple designs is often more involved than the final product would suggest. In this course, join Von Glitschka as he walks through the process of creating and styling a set of icon motifs. Von dives into the fundamentals of creating icon ideas, explaining how basic drawing can help to facilitate the digital design process. He also shines a spotlight on aesthetic rules and methods that can help you craft well-designed icons, as well as how to export vector and raster icons. Plus, Von provides you with some perspective by sharing the work, methods, and sketches of several other designers.
