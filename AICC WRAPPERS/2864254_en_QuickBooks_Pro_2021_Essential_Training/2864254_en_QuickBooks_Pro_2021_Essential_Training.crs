Do you wonder how to create and back up your company's QuickBooks file and quickly set up shop? Or how to add your banking information, credit cards, and historical data to the chart of accounts? How about how to set up your customers, vendors, employees, and inventory items? In this course, instructor Jess Stratton answers all these questions and more. Jess goes over the day-to-day operations that keep your business running: creating estimates, invoices, and sales receipts; processing payments; recording deposits; and printing checks. She covers how to run reports; find data about your business; and close the books, with end-of-year preparations. Jess concludes with a discussion on how to customize QuickBooks to meet your companyâ€™s specific needs as efficiently as possible.
