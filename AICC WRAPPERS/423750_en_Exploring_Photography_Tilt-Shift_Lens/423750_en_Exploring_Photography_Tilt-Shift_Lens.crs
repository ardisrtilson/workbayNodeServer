[Course_Description]
A tilt-shift lens is a specialized piece of gear that expands your creative options. With a tilt-shift lens, you can fix distorted verticals in architectural photos, greatly expand depth of field, and create special optical effects. You can simulate many of these things in post-processing, but a tilt-shift lens lets you experiment in the fieldâ€”and seeing the results as you work can affect the way you shoot a scene. In this course, photographer and educator Justin Reznick demonstrates how to use a tilt-shift lens in a variety of shooting scenarios. He shows how to shift for perspective control and panoramas, and tilt for miniature style photos and sharpness from front to back.
