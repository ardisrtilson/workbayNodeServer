[Course_Description]
Are you a music producer or composer, and are you curious about the MIDI tools available in Logic Pro? In this course, instructor Evan Sutton walks you through the various stock MIDI plug-ins and effects included in Logic Pro X and how you can use each in your own productions. Evan begins with classic arpeggiator patterns and alternate uses. He shows you how to use the chord trigger and the transposer functions independently and with the arpeggiator, then goes into adding complexity and rhythmic expressiveness with the note repeater. Evan explains how to make controllers more expressive and how to adjust velocity curves. He discusses how to use the modulator for a whole new level of control and the randomizer for a bit of musical chaos. Evan concludes with some of his favorite Scripter presets and uses.
