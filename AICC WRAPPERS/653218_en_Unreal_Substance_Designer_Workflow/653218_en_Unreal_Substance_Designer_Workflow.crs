[Course_Description]
Explore the integration of Substance Designer—a powerful tool for creating textures for 3D art, visualization projects, and games—with Unreal Engine. This course provides a solid foundation of the principles of texture creation in Substance Designer for use in Unreal Engine. Instructor Scott Pagano explains how to import a model into Substance Designer and bake AO, curvature, and ID maps. He discusses the advantages of system-based procedural texture creation, and shows how to create both image file output and substances which can be used and modified directly in the Unreal editor.
