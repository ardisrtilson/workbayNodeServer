[Course_Description]
Microsoft Cognitive Services opens up artificial intelligence to every developer. Search is a core pillar of Cognitive Services, allowing your application to tap into an ad-free, internet-scale search engine—Microsoft Bing—with access to billions of webpages, images, videos, and news results. This course shows how to use the search APIs in Cognitive Services to execute simple text-based, image, and video searches. Plus, explore the Bing Autosuggest API, which allows you to submit a query and return a list of suggested terms that other users have entered, and Bing Custom Search, which restricts search results to the domains, sites, and webpages that you choose.
