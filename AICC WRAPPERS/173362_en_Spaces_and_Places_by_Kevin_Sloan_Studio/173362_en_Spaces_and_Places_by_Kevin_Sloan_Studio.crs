[Course_Description]
Cities are in the perpetual process of becomingâ€”and evolving ever faster as industry and technology advance. Architects like Kevin Sloan ensure community still has a place at the heart of our urban spaces and places. We follow Kevin as he visits three of his favorite projects in the Dallas/Fort Worth area of Texas: Vitruvian Park, a landscape-driven green space; Dallas Urban Reserve, an abandoned, rubbish-strewn lot remade into a contemporary subdivision; and Airfield Falls, a water district property redesigned to showcase the area's aviation history and water-wise landscaping practices. Watch and learn how inventive design solutions like these will help define the future of modern cities.
