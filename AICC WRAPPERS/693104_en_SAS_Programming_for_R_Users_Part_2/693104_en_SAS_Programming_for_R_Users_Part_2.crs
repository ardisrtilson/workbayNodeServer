In this course, Jordan Bakerman walks through essential SAS programming concepts. To begin, he discusses random number generation and plotting, including how to create standard R plots and enhance the plot. He then dives into a discussion of descriptive procedures, Output Delivery System (ODS), and macros, sharing how to create data tables with ODS, create macro programs with macro statements, and more.
