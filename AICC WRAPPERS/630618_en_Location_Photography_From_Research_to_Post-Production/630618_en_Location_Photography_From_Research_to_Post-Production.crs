When you're on location, getting the right shot can require imagination, resourcefulness, and even a bit of improvisation. In this course, follow along with photographer Joe McNally as he goes on location to photograph a belly dancer. Throughout the course, Joe highlights his entire workflowâ€”from researching the subject and gathering the right gear for the shoot, to setting up the shot and dealing with on-set challenges, all the way to post-production. He discusses several techniques for working with a dancer, as well as techniques for transforming a location so that it best complements your subject.
