[Course_Description]
GitLab is a popular open-source alternative to tools like GitHub and Bitbucket. In contrast to its competition, GitLab places an emphasis on self-hosting (although you can use their hosted version as well). In this course, learn how to install and use this web-based Git-repository manager for code management. Instructor Josh Samuelson kicks off the course by explaining how to create a project and navigate the GitLab interface. He then digs into how to work with GitLab for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) and source control, explaining how to leverage its collaboration features, create and run a pipeline, and more.
