[Course_Description]
Building great designs is a team effort. It requires thorough UX research and planning and a collaborative toolset for execution. Sketch is an industry-standard app for website prototyping. Using it in tandem with the InVision Design System Manager (DSM) allows you to save and manage elements of your design, so you can easily reuse and update assets. In this course, instructor Emmanuel Henri guides you through the process of designing a robust website with these tools and modern UX best practices. Discover how to research and find visual inspiration for your design, create reusable symbol-based elements, build out the website in sections, and manage the components in DSM.
