[Course_Description]
When someone presents new information to us either in the workplace or our personal lives, it is our nature to judge them as a credible—or unreliable—source. This instinct is critical skill for our survival. We all want to come across as confident and smart, and so we often take on behaviors that we think make us exhibit these qualities. In this course, Dr. Todd Dewett highlights the physical cues that project intelligence and suggests some specific behaviors you can adopt to make a good first impression, such as effectively listening, not being afraid to admit your imperfections, and speaking modestly but authoritatively.
