[Course_Description]
Spinnaker is an open-source, multicloud continuous delivery platform for releasing software changes with high velocity and confidence. It boasts a flexible service model and a solid set of integration options, and also works particularly well with cloud native environmentsâ€”particularly Kubernetes. In this course, learn how to use Spinnaker to enable continuous delivery with Kubernetes. Instructor Robert Starmer shows how to deploy Spinnaker, add a container app, and develop a pipeline for an application to get it properly deployed into a production environment. Plus, learn how Spinnaker supports scaling and rollbacks, making the process rather straightforward.
