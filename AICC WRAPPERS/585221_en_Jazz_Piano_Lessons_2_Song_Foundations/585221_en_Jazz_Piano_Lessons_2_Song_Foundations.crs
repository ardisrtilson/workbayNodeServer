Learn essential techniques to enhance your jazz piano skills. In this course—the second in a series focusing on learning how to play jazz piano—learn concepts that can provide you with a solid foundation as a pianist. Grammy-winning keyboardist George Whitty helps you get started with two-handed harmony, and helps to bolster your jazz vocabulary by covering basic—and instantly recognizable—bluesy chord voicings. George also discusses the pentatonic scale, and shows how to play everything in your jazz piano toolbox over the F7 blues. Note: This course was recorded and produced by ArtistWorks. We're pleased to host this training in our library.
