[Course_Description]
The wedding may be over, but the photos aren't quite finished until you've done everything you can to make them look their best. In this course, teacher, author, and professional photographer Chris Orwig revisits the images he shot in Wedding Photography for Everyone: Bridal Portraits and shows how to make natural and creative enhancements with Adobe Photoshop. Learn how to correct color, remove blemishes, make eyes sparkle, whiten teeth, enhance light, and craft a sepia-toned black-and-white portrait from a regular color photograph.
