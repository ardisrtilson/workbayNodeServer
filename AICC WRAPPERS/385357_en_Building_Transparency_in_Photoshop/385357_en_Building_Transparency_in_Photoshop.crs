[Course_Description]
Learn a new trick to give designs and illustrations more depth and volume â€¦ transparency! Steve Caplin takes the image of a skull and creates a transparent duplicate, showing you how to replicate the effect in just a few steps. Using the Apply Median filter and the Image Warp and Smudge tools, he transforms the skull into a glass-like structure that reveals and refracts the environment around it. The entire technique takes just 20 minutes.
