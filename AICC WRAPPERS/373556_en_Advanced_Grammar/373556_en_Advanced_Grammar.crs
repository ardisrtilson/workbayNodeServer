[Course_Description]
Losing confidence in an idea—even a spectacular one—is easy if it's communicated in an email or letter riddled with grammatical errors. In this course, Judy Steiner-Williams helps you review basic grammar rules and then focuses on more advanced grammar principles such as using correct words, locating incorrect grammar in sentences and paragraphs, and reviewing parts of speech, punctuation, and proper sentence structure.
