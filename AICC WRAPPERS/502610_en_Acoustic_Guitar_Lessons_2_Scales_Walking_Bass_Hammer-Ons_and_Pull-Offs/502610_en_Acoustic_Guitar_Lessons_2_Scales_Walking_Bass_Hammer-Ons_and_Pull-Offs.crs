[Course_Description]
The bluegrass style is one of the most rewarding and technically demanding ways to play guitar. Learn how to play bluegrass guitar or improve your current flatpicking and fretting skills in this courseâ€”part 2 of the Bluegrass Guitar Lessons series with Grammy-winning flatpicker Bryan Sutton. Learn how to build strength and fingerboard awareness, and expand what you can do with the rhythm guitar with walking bass movement and advanced scales. Find out how to create more expressive sounds and play more efficiently with hammer-ons and pull-offs, and how to use a capo and slide. Watch at your own pace; start and stop where and when you need. Everything that Bryan breaks down he puts back together in chapters 4 and 5, where he shows how to apply what you've learned to a selection of popular bluegrass tunes that are important for the repertoire of any bluegrass guitarist.
