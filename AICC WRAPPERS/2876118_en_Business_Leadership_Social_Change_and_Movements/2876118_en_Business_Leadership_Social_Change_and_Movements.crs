[Course_Description]
Social movements matter. They matter to your customers, your workers, and to members of the communities where you operate and sell your products and services. Yet historically, businesses have largely avoided involvement with controversial causes. In the face of todayâ€™s fomenting social movements, companies must take action and proactively demonstrate where they stand on these issues. Companies can no longer afford to remain neutral if they want to maintain competitive advantage. In this course, Leslie Crutchfield shares knowledge and tools to help you understand and engage with movements in ways that can achieve positive results both for your company and society at large. Drawing on her research and experience working directly with hundreds of companies and foundations, Leslie presents frameworks to stimulate your thinking, and details real world examples that demonstrate how companies navigate the complex terrain of social change movements.
