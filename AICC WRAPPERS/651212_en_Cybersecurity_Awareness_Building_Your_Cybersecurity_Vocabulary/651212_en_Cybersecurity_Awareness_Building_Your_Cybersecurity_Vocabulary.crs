[Course_Description]
Cybersecurity can be an intimidating world to navigate. To speak intelligently on the subject, one must have a basic understanding of certain acronyms and terminologyâ€”much of which isn't immediately easy to decode. This practical course was designed to help beginners build their cybersecurity vocabulary, and give them the foundational knowledge they need to approach this subject with confidence. Here, instructor Serge Borso breaks down the vocabulary heard in the cybersecurity industry, and presents scenarios where those words, phrases, and acronyms are used. Upon wrapping up this course, you should have a solid foundation of what cybersecurity is, and what it entails. This course was created and produced by Mentor Source, Inc. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
