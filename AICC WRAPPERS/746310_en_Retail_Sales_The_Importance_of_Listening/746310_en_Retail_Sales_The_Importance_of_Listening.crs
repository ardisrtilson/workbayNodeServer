[Course_Description]
Poor listening often leads to customer frustration. When a retail employee merely hears a customer—instead of actively listening to them—they're less able to determine precisely what that person needs. This course was designed to help you avoid these kinds of miscommunications. Join Myra Golden as she goes over how important listening is in retail sales, and how you can get even better at it with each interaction. Help your customers feel heard and understood by learning practical steps for better listening. Discover the elements of effective listening—including how to listen with the intent to understand instead of the intent to reply—as well as how to find upsell opportunities and create calm with an angry customer.
