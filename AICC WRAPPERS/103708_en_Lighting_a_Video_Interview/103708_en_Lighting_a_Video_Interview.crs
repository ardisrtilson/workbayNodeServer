Interview lighting should make the subject and the interviewer look great. But you need the right equipment and the right understanding of the shoot's goals to accurately control its look and feel. Join Rich Harrington and Jim Ball as they walk through the gear and information you need to properly light a video interview. Discover how to determine the mood and genre of the interview, properly expose your shots, establish a schedule for the shoot, choose a backdrop, and frame the shot. Plus, learn techniques for controlling the light with flagging, bouncing, diffusion, and other techniques used by the pros. This course was created and produced by RHED Pixel.
