A great artist makes the most of their toolset, whether the tools are physical or digital. This course is tailored specifically to artists who want to transition their analog skills to a digital canvas. Comic book illustrator and video game artist Daniel Lieske shares tips and techniques to help you simplify your workflow, organize your illustrations, and start creating art. Daniel shows how to use digital brushes, selections, masks, color pickers, texture tools, and additional Photoshop features. After demonstrating how to use Photoshop, he takes you through the creation and completion of three full illustration projects.
