[Course_Description]
Guides, grids, and tools related to these bring structure and consistency to your designs. By suggesting visual relationships, such tools can help you design more efficiently and experiment more easily with different layout options. In this course, learn how to work with the suite of guide and grid tools in Adobe Illustrator to improve your designs and mockups. Review fundamental concepts—including how to set basic guide options and grid preferences—and discover how to create modular and baseline grids, and work with perspective and diagonal grids. Plus, learn how to create a grid from an object mosaic, a logo from a grid of circles, and more.
