[Course_Description]
Brochures are essential marketing tools, which establish brands and help them cut through the clutter from the competition. Here designer and educator Nigel French taps into his 20+ years of professional experience and shows how to use Adobe InDesign (with some help from Illustrator and Photoshop) to create a brochure. Throughout the course, Nigel puts each concept into context as he steps through the creation of a travel brochure. He explains how to prepare photos, create maps, place and fine-tune text, and even create a 3D mockup of the project that will fit nicely in your portfolio. Upon wrapping up this course, you'll be ready to produce a stylish brochure of your own.
