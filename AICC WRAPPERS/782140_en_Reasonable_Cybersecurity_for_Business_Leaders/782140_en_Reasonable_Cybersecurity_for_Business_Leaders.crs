[Course_Description]
In today's connected world, no business is completely secure. The Federal Trade Commission acknowledges there may be breaches that companies can't control. Instead, they require organizations to practice reasonable cybersecurity. The definition and standard for reasonable cybersecurity is still evolving, but business leaders can achieve compliance by understanding the basic requirements. This course provides an introduction to reasonable cybersecurity, distilling the most important information in under 30 minutes. Learn from the example of Equifax, a company that didn't realize it was vulnerable until it was too late, and explore an FTC-recommended security framework, NIST, that can help you identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from security issues, without sacrificing business productivity or innovation.
