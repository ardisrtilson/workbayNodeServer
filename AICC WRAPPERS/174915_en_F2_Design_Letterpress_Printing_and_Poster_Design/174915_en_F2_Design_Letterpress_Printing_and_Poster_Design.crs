[Course_Description]
Sometimes the best designs start offlineâ€”where there's no Cmd+Z. Dirk Fowler, graphic designer, professor, and poster maker, invites us into his studio, among the quiet clacking of his letterpress machines, to watch the work that goes into his simple yet evocative poster designs for musicians like Jeff Tweedy and Miranda Lambert. Dirk explains why things that are handcrafted are less likely to end up in the trash, and reveals the satisfaction he gets from making things with his hands every day.
