Managing the inherent tension between the friendliness that encourages rapport and the assertiveness that is required to be effective can be tricky. In this course, adapted from the American Negotiation Institute podcast Negotiate Anything, Kwame Christian discusses with Hamilton Chan how to build rapport, stand your ground, and manage the flow of information. Hamilton is the head of executive education and visiting professor of business and technology at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles and CEO of Coaching for Startups LLC. He explains why rapport is so powerful and provides tips to stay strong at the negotiation table. Plus, learn why itâ€™s so important to understand your options before you start difficult conversations. This course was created by the American Negotiation Institute. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
