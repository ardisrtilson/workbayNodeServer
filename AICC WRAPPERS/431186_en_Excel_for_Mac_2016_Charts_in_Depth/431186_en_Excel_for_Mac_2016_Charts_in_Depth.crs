[Course_Description]
Charts allow you to communicate information visually, with greater impact than tables or raw data. They also happen to be one of the most powerful and easy-to-use features in Microsoft Excel for Mac. Let Dennis Taylor show you how to create different kinds of Excel charts, from column, bar, and line charts to doughnuts and scatter charts, and decide which type works best for your data. Learn how to fine-tune your chart's colors and style; add titles, labels, and legends; insert shapes and pictures; and pull data from multiple sources. Along the way, Dennis offers shortcuts and tips for being more productive and efficient.
