[Course_Description]
Trust is a fundamental aspect of any productive relationship. In business, trust has been proven to decrease turnover, increase innovation, and improve team performance. When trust is compromised, relationships and productivity can suffer. This course shows how professionals of all kinds can build trust with colleagues across their organization. Kelley School of Business senior lecturer Brenda Bailey-Hughes explains how to prove you are trustworthy, even in challenging situations like remote teams, and integrate trust-building habits into your daily routine. She also explains how to practice trust—trusting yourself and others—and rebuild trust when it has been lost. The course features live-action scenarios and practical strategies for boosting trust that will help you apply the concepts to your most important relationships.
