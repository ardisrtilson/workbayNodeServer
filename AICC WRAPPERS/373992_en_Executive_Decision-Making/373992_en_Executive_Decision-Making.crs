[Course_Description]
Making executive decisions requires making tough choices. The decision to lay people off, halt major projects, or to take your company global all come with a significant amount of riskâ€”both business risk and professional risk. In this course, executive coach Mike Figliuolo explains the difference between executive decision making and day-to-day decision making and shows how to equip yourself so you can make high-quality decisions with far-reaching positive impact. Mike helps you find the data and tools to support your decision, make the call, communicate decisions effectively, and lead your organization through the change. He'll also address common problems that arise from these high-profile decisions: cultural differences, quality of information, trust, and accountability, to name a few.
