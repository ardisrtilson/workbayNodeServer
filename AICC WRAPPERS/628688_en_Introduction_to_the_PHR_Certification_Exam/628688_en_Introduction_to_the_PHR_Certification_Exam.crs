[Course_Description]
HR pros must remain current on HR trends, best practices, and legislation. Certification is one way to demonstrate that commitment. The Human Resources Certification Institute (HRCI®) Professional of Human Resources (PHR) certification is the industry standard. If you're interested in PHR certification and the exam process, this course is the place to start. Joanne Walters reviews the exam format and the six major topic areas: business management and strategy, HR development, compensation and benefits, workforce planning and employment, employee and labor relations, and risk management. She also explains how the exam is scored and what you can expect after you receive the preliminary pass or fail on the day of the exam. Disclaimer: This course is not produced nor endorsed by HRCI®.
