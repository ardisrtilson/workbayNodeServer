[Course_Description]
The success of a company hinges on the quality of its workforce. But when it comes to making strategic business decisions, human resources—the part of an organization whose central function is to support its talent—isn't always positioned as a strategic partner. In this course, learn about the evolving role of human resources, and explore strategies and techniques that can help HR business partners become more effective in their roles, and help business leaders understand how to best partner with the HR function. Instructor Michael McLernon discusses the function of HR within an organization, and the skills needed to be successful as an HR business partner, regardless of company size or structure. In addition, he goes over the primary role of an HR business partner, highlighting specific areas where this role can add value to a business. Michael also covers how to engage with leaders, managers, and employees on key talent initiatives such as organization design, performance management, and employee engagement. Finally, he shows how to assess the impact of your efforts, and modify your approach as your organization—or the scope of your role—changes.
