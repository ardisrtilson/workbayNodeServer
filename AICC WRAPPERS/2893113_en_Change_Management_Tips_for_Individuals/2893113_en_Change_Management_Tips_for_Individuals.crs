If there’s one thing you can always rely on, it’s change. And while change has its many pros and cons, it can be harder to navigate when you’re the one having to embrace the change as opposed to initiating it. In this quick course from change management expert Dr. Eric Zackrison, learn how to go with the flow and wield organizational change to your advantage. Gain strategies for how to adapt quickly, tips on what is and isn’t in your control, and advice for how to show your bosses that you are a can-do, make-it-happen team player. This course was created by Madecraft. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
