[Course_Description]
Amusements parks, boardwalks, tacky tourist stands, and interesting characters are defining features of many seaside destinations, and no place brings them all together like New York's Coney Island. In this course, photographer and educator Steve Simon goes on a photo expedition to this landmark location and shows how to capture the carnival rides, colorful characters, and boardwalk fare.
