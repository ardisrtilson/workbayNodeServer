[Course_Description]
Whether you're photographing a room for an architectural magazine, for a real-estate ad, or for an interior decorator friend, interior spaces present a variety of photographic challenges. In this course, photographer Richard Klein visits two homes, photographing their interiors while explaining the essential shooting and lighting techniques behind making these spaces look their best. The course describes the best ways to light interior elements to show their texture and form, and contains tips on staging rooms to make them more inviting. Richard also tackles the tricky challenges that windows and exterior lighting introduce: how do you adjust exposure to capture interior details without overexposing the windows?
