[Course_Description]
Do you often find yourself in a place—at work or at home—but not present? This audio-only course covers skills and tools that can help you set a strong foundation for your journey into mindfulness. Instructors Tara Brach and Jack Kornfield show, for example, how simply pausing for a moment or steadying your breath can help you learn to bring yourself more fully into the present moment, develop greater awareness of your thoughts, and practice receiving the wisdom of your body in the spirit of friendly, open inquiry. With these practices, you can come home to yourself, your heart, and the present moment. Each lesson offers clear instructions for integrating mindfulness into your workday right away. This course was created by Sounds True. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
