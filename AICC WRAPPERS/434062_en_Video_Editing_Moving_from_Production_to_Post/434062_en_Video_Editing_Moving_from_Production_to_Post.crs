[Course_Description]
With projects moving at lightning speed, fix it in post is no longer possible. (If it ever was!) However, learning smart production strategies will streamline video editing and maximize your creative choices. Watch this course to learn how to prepare your projects, including interview-driven, multicamera, and asset-driven productions, for editing in Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro. Amy DeLouise reviews production planning, on-set strategies for effective media management, and tips for creating transcripts, editing scripts, and asset lists for editors. During post-production kickoff, she talks about managing your client's expectations: balancing their needs with the realities of production. With any luck, you can reconcile the two in post, using Amy's instructions for setting up Final Cut and Premiere Pro projects for success. The final chapter includes bonus post-production strategies for future-proofing and exporting projects.
