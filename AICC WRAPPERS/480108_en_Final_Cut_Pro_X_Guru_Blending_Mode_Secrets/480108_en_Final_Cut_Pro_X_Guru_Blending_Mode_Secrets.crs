[Course_Description]
One of the great adjustment tools available in Final Cut Pro is its blending modes. Blending modes permit nuanced and complex interactions between two clips, especially for compositing. Learn the key ingredients to everyday comfort with blending modes, and dig deep into complex layer construction with multiple effects, in this course with FCP guru Jeff Greenberg. Learn how to draw on text, color correct footage, use luma keys for selections, embed video in text or logos, borrow content from Motion and third-party plugins, and see how blending modes can help you create custom, professional looks.
