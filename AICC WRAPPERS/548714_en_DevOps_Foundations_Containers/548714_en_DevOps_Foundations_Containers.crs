Software containers are the future of app deploymentâ€”and an instrumental component of any DevOps strategy. They package everything a program needs to run, allowing developers to move applications from one environment to another relatively hassle free. In this course, cloud-computing luminary David Linthicum dives into the exciting world of software containers. David goes over the basics of containers, including an overview of the fundamental steps involved in building container-based software, followed by some examples of real-world applications that leverage containers. The course concludes with container standards and best practices, and the tools, processes, and skills a DevOps professional needs to work with them.
