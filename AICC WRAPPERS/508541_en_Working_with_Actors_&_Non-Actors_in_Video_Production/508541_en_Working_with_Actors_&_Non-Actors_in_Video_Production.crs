[Course_Description]
Filmmaker Kelley Slagle shares her unique perspective on working with actors, based on her experience both behind and in front of the camera. She discusses how to build great relationships and get the best performances from your actorsâ€”whether they're professional or non-professional. Learn about casting the right talent, and breaking down your scripts and characters so actors can better understand them. Then discover how to conduct effective rehearsals, direct actors on set, and make non-actors feel engaged and comfortable. Plus, get tips for special scenarios, such as directing actors in scenes with special effects, conducting interviews, and working with sensitive subjects and children.
