[Course_Description]
It's time for CAD to be fun again! Onshape is the first full-cloud 3D CAD system. It runs in a web browser and on any iOS or Android device—making it easy to design anywhere, anytime. Your team can consider design alternatives and see what everyone is doing in real time—spending more time designing better products and less time wrestling with document management. Best of all, it's completely free to get started. Explore the full capabilities of Onshape in this course with CAD expert Gabriel Corbett. Gabriel shows how to sketch basic geometry; revolve and extrude 3D parts; trim and extend objects; add fillets, holes, and chamfers; and combine parts into complex assemblies. He shows how to design smarter, not harder, and get up to speed quickly with Onshape's toolset. By the end of the course, you'll know how to produce detailed drawings, ready for manufacturing, complete with dimensions, notes, and revision data.
