[Course_Description]
Anger can be toxic. When you’re angry, your body shifts into a state that isn’t healthy, which can affect your cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems. Additionally, holding grudges can lead to declines in your physical health over time. In this installment of The Science of Compassion, Kelly McGonigal shows how you can transform anger through compassion. Kelly explains how to use your own experience of anger, resentment, or even hate as an opportunity to both open and heal your heart. This audio-only course focuses on the benefits of and the best strategies for finding compassion for people who have harmed you or harmed others, and how to see someone who hurt you as someone who is also hurting. Kelly also shares stories of forgiveness and compassion that show that there are many ways to work with anger, and there's no one right way to find compassion in tough circumstances.
