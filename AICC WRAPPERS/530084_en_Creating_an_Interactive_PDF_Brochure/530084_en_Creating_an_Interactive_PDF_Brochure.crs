[Course_Description]
Whether the recipient of your PDF file decides to print it or keep it digital, you can get more value out of your brochure by designing it with interactivity. Digital publications can behave similar to a webpage, allowing readers to quickly jump to another section, visit a related website, start an email, and even play a video right in the document. Join Mike Rankin as he shows you how to add interactive elements to your materials.
