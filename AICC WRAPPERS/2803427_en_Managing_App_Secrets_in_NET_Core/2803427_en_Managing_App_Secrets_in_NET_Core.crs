Managing secrets is an important part of securing data in your ASP.NET Core applications. Secrets can be anything from API keys to user passwords to database connection strings. You need to ensure this critical data is accessible to admins and developers without exposing it to attackers. This short, security-focused course explains where to store secrets, and how to set, access, replace, and remove secrets locally using the ASP.NET Core Secret Manager. Finally, discover how to set up Azure Key Vault to work with secrets once you have deployed apps to the cloud.
