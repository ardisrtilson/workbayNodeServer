You are never too experienced or too successful to benefit from a mentor. While many think mentors are for those new to the workforce, the truth is you can benefit from the advice and opportunities offered by a mentor at any stage in your career. This short course from Aimee Bateman, the founder of Careercake, explains how to identify a mentor and get the most from the relationship. Find out what mentoring really means and why it's so important, and learn how to initiate this valuable relationship and maximize the value of meetings with your mentor to benefit your career. This course was created by Careercake, the careers content platform. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
