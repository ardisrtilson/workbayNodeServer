[Course_Description]
How does an aspiring photographer transition from a 9-to-5 to doing what they love full time? Cindy Loughridge is an inspiring example. Finding communities online were crucial to her development as photographerâ€”and getting her lucky break. Learn how she capitalized on the treasure trove of information available through Flickr and Instagram, and how the support of other photographers there led her to film. We also join Cindy and her Flickr friends on a photo walk through the streets (and on the beaches) of San Francisco.
