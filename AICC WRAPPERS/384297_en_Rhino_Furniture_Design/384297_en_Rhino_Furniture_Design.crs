[Course_Description]
Learn a process-based approach for the designing furniture with Rhino, focusing on the creation of complex surfaces that leverage the powerful modeling and prototyping tools of Rhino 3D. This course has four parts. General concepts Start by framing your work and exploring big questions such as What is furniture design? Case studies Next you will learn by doing, modeling some of the important pieces of furniture history (such as the Thonet caf√© chair and Eames DCM chair) to gain a better understanding of the masters of design. Design process Explore the furniture design process by following along with the research, schematic design, design development, and documentation of a brand-new furniture design. Extend and translate Last learn how to translate your furniture design to other software by exporting assets for 3d printing, rendering, and game development. The training is focused on the creation of complex organic surfaces while you maintain precise control of that geometry's accuracy. Packed with tips and timesaving strategies, these tutorials will not only make you a better furniture designer, but a faster one as well.
