As a manager, whether managing your team face to face or virtually, you need to achieve goals and drive results. If your team is disengaged and disconnected, achieving business goals is challenging. In this course, Ireland-based organizational psychologist Erin Shrimpton teaches you how to apply principles of coaching and organizational psychology to foster connection and engagement and help your team thrive and deliver in a virtual work environment. Erin starts by going over the key building blocks for leading a virtual team, then covers the best ways to engage with your team both as individuals and the team as a whole.
