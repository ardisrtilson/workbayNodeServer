[Course_Description]
Most applications grow and change over time. The challenge for developers is to make sure their projects keep pace with ever-evolving frameworks and security standards. This course shows you how to maintain your Angular applications and prepare them for growth. Instructor Emmanuel Henri reviews the upgrade path from Angular 2 to Angular 4 and introduces best practices to help your application scale for organic growth, integrate other projects and frameworks, and accommodate shifts to deployment models such as continuous integration/continuous delivery. Plus, learn how to recognize when it's time to decommission a feature, module, application, or framework version.
