[Course_Description]
Mobile photography can mean everything from iPhone and Android snapshots to sophisticated image editing on a phone or tablet. Mobile Photography Weekly is the weekly series that covers it all, from Instagram to Photoshop Fix, from camera phone tripod mounts to add-on lenses. Tune in each Tuesday to learn a new tip or technique, discover new apps and add-ons, and get the most out of the mobile photography revolution. Note: Because this is an ongoing series, viewers will not receive a certificate of completion.
