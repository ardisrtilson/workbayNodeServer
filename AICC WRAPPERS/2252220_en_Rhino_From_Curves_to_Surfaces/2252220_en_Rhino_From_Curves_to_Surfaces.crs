[Course_Description]
Rhino is an advanced 3D modeling tool used in architecture and industrial design. In this course, you can learn tips and techniques for a modeling process to make complex forms from simpler forms: from curves to surfaces. Instructor Dave Schultze starts with his intersection technique for quickly building and changing models. Then he proceeds through a variety of modeling projects that showcase some of Rhinoâ€™s most powerful commands, from building a space helmet with Rail Revolve, to modeling a fabric cape from smaller curves and a loft, to building a realistic 3D gear. Plus, learn tips for organic modeling and adding details to curved surfaces.
