[Course_Description]
Drop a rock. It falls and hits the ground. Once you understand brain evolution, many of your decisions will become easily predictable. To a scary degree, we are walking robots with knee-jerk responses, and not the rational geniuses with free will that we like to imagine. What if you understood how the brain really makes decisions, and could consistently influence it? In this dynamic course, neuromarketing expert Tim Ash teaches you key strategies for influencing the primitive and irrational parts of the brain that are really in charge of our actions. Learn how to tap into powerful universal motivations and automatic responses to deliver your marketing message on-target every time. Walk away with a new perspective on the brain, and several durable and practical strategies for ethically influencing your audience. Are you ready to be inspired?
