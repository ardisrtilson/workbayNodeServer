[Course_Description]
The excitement of filmmaking can entice anyone to rush through, or completely skip, pre-production steps to jump behind the camera and start filming. Giving in to this temptation can result in mistakes and costly delays, which you can't afford when shooting a low-budget or ultra-low-budget film. Emmy-winning director Eduardo Angel knows the importance of spending adequate time and resources in pre-production. In this course, Eduardo takes you behind the scenes, through the actual pre-production process of an ultra-low-budget film, sharing real-life insights from concept to distribution, while exploring the apps, tools, and challenges that go into each and every decision. He also looks at the most essential pre-production tasks, so you'll know what you need before you step foot on a set or arrive at your location. Eduardo shows you how to work on a shoestring budget, without compromising the integrity of your story, and even how to pre-shoot the entire film.
