Learn the tools and best practices for measuring and correcting color in Adobe Camera Raw. Photographer and teacher Taz Tally shows how to evaluate the color, tone, brightness, and contrast of your photosâ€”by the histogram and by the numbers. Taz shows you how to accurately evaluate and adjust critical highlights and shadows. Then he'll cover correcting skin tones, performing white-balance adjustments, and warming and cooling images. Interested in improving your product photography? Learn how to perform targeted adjustments and correct poor exposure. Taz also shows how to make creative color adjustments to change the mood or add artistic touches. Some challenge videos help you to practice what you've learned along the way.
