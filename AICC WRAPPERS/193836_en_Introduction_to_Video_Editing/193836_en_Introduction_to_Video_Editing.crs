[Course_Description]
Get a project-based approach to the aesthetic and technical aspects of video editing. Staff author Ashley Kennedy begins this introductory course by exploring storytelling and an editor's role in it. Using classic and contemporary examples in cinema, she examines the grammar of editing, showing how an editor's decisions impact emotion, meaning, and advancement of story. Then, after a short introduction to the major NLEs (nonlinear editing applications), she edits two projects: a short narrative film and a documentary-style piece with interview and B-roll. The course explores each project in a broad sense, showing proper workflow from start to finish, but draws on specific lessons from the beginning of the course.
