While many professionals are offered training that helps them boost the skills they need for their immediate roles, most are left to figure out the financial side of their company for themselves. If you're looking for some clarity on your company's bottom line (or profitability), then this course is for you. Join instructor Jane Barratt as she digs into key financial practices and accounting concepts that can help you grasp the big picture of the economy, your company, and how you fit into the equation. Learn how you can contribute to the bottom line, regardless of your role, by increasing revenue and decreasing costs. Discover how money flows through an organization, what ratios to look out for that show key measures of success, how to read your company's financial statements, and more.
