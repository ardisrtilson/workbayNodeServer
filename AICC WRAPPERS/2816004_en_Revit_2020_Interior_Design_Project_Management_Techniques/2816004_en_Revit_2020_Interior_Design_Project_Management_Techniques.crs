[Course_Description]
Autodesk Revit is most often thought of in connection with architects and engineers, but in this course, instructor Chanté Bright explores using the power of Revit for interior design project management. Chanté covers using Revit for schedule tracking, material selection, life-cycle costing, and more. Revit offers many little-known features that make it a great choice for an interior designer’s project management toolkit.
