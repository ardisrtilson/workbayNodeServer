[Course_Description]
From sexual harassment, to social conditioning toward perfectionism, to simply being taken seriously by men, women are still in the position of having to fight for what they deserve. This course is a roadmap to self-advocacy and career success. Women—and their male allies—can learn how to advocate for raises, build self-confidence, convey executive presence, and stop sexual harassment. Aspiring board members can also learn why it’s important to stay true to yourself: your unique perspective is an asset, not a liability. This course includes videos from: Sallie Krawcheck, CEO and cofounder of Ellevest, an investing platform for women Valerie Purdie Greenaway, social psychologist at Columbia University Gretchen Carlson, TV commentator, journalist, author, Ted Talk alum, and female empowerment advocate Claire Shipman, TV journalist and author of The Confidence Code Halla Tómasdóttir, Icelandic businesswoman, politician, and speaker Note: This course was produced by Big Think.
