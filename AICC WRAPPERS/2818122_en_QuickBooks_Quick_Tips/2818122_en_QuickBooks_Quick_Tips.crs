[Course_Description]
QuickBooks was designed to make day-to-day business tasks—sending money, receiving money, and assessing your company's financial situation—easier to manage. This course provides concise, actionable tips for using the popular business accounting software to manage your daily operations and assess your company's overall performance. Jess Stratton covers essential processes such as backing up and restoring a company file, discounting an item or invoice, creating statements, and voiding invoices and checks. Plus, she shares how to use reporting tools to assess your company's overall health, as well as how to extend QuickBooks by including your logo on invoices, adding a password-protected close date to your company file, and more.
