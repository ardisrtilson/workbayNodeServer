[Course_Description]
Money in Excel is a new Excel template that helps Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365) subscribers manage their personal finances with ease. Instead of manually moving transactions to Excel, users can securely connect their bank and credit card accounts and start slicing and dicing information quickly and easily. In this brief course, Jess Stratton shows how to find, install, and start using Money in Excel. Jess shows how to connect your accounts and answers your questions about security. She then shows how to categorize transactions and view snapshots that highlight where you're spending the most money.
