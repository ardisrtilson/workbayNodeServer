NVivo is the leading tool for qualitative analysis. Qualitative data is difficult to gather and process, but with NVivo Starter 11 for Windows, you have powerful tools at your disposal. This course explores how to leverage NVivo Starter for collecting and analyzing text-based research data. David Rivers shows how to create a new project and add nodesâ€”the containers that keep your NVivo data organized. Then learn how to import data, documents, and notes; code content; analyze data with queries; and visualize your results with NVivo's charts and diagrams.
