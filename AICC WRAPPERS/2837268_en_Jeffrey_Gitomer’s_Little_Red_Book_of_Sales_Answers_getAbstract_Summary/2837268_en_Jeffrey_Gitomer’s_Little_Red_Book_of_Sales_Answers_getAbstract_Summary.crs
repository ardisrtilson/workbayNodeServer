Sales expert Jeffrey Gitomer isn’t reinventing the sales wheel; he’s just showing you how it turns. Whether you’ve been in sales for five weeks or five years, you know which questions you want answered. How do I make a cold call? When do I ask for the sale? How do I get referrals? In his book Jeffrey Gitomer's Little Red Book of Sales Answers, Gitomer answers these questions and more with a mix of common sense and hard-won experience. He doesn’t provide shortcuts or a magic sales formula. Rather, he advocates hard work and preparation.

Get practical strategies for overcoming objections, getting more referrals, preparing for your sales calls, and more.
