Learn how to use the powerful UAD-2 and Apollo software/hardware combo from Universal Audio to mix down songs and emulate classic analog sounds. J. Scott Giaquinta shows how to connect the Apollo system to a computer and DAW, navigate around the UAD interface, and work with features such as the UAD Meter, Unison tracking, and wordclocking. Then he digs deep into the core plugins, including the 1176 and LA-2A amplifiers, as well as the compressors, equalizers, delay and modulation effects, special processing units, and reverbs that make Universal Audio's classic sounds some of the best in today's digital audio world.
