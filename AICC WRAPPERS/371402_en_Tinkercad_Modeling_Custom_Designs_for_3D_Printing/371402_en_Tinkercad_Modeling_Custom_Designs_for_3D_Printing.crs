[Course_Description]
There's nothing like one of a kind! In this course, Kacie Hultgren builds on her 3D scanning courses, teaching a workflow for turning 3D scans into personalized, custom products. Her example uses a free, easy-to-use program called Tinkercad to model a custom trophy, but you can remix your own 3D scans into portraits, jewelry, cake toppers, and more.
