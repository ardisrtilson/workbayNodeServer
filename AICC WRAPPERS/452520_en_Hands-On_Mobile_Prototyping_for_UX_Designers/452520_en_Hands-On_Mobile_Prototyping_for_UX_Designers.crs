[Course_Description]
Design research and user requirements only get you so far. Sometimes you have to go hands on to create the user experience your mobile app users deserve. Explore the various methods for prototyping mobile applications, from analog to digital, and their place in the UX design process. Diane Cronenwett explains why prototyping is so important in UX, and compares the merits of low-fidelity methods like pen and paper to high-fidelity tools such as Photoshop. She then teaches various paper and digital prototyping methods, using tools such as stop-motion animation, Keynote, InVision, and Flinto. Using these prototyping techniques, you'll be able to refine your designs and get more targeted feedback from your users.
