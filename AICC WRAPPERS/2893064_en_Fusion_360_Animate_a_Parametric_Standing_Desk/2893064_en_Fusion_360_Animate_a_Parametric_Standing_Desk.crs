[Course_Description]
Fusion 360 is a unique CAD package for product design. In this course, which is a companion to Fusion 360: Design a Parametric Standing Desk, product designer Kevin Kennedy teaches you how to animate parts and assemblies to communicate design functionality and assembly operations to project stakeholders. Beginning with the completed design from the previous course, Kevin shares practical skills that apply to creating product animations and exploded views. He shows how to leverage the animation workspace in Fusion 360 to evaluate and communicate design functionality, and to illustrate assemblies. Note: This course was created by Product Design Online. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
