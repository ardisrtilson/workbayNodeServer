If you want your team to trust you as a leader, it's important to articulate who you are, what you stand for, and why you're excited to lead them. In this course, author and executive leadership coach Mike Figliuolo shows you how to distill your leadership philosophy down to one simple page covering four critical aspects of leadership: leading yourself, leading the thinking, leading your people, and leading a balanced life. Get hands-on with introspective exercises that help you define and practice leading authentically, with a style that's uniquely yours. Along the way, discover how to share and socialize your vision, make decisions, motivate and mentor, and keep your whole life in perspective.
