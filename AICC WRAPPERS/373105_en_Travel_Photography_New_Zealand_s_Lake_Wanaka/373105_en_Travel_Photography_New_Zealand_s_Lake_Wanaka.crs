[Course_Description]
It can be hard to make photographs of iconic landscapes seem fresh. In this course, professional photographer Justin Reznick heads to New Zealand's South Island, to try and capture the famous lone tree of Lake Wanaka in a new light. He photographs the scene in many different ways over the course of a single day, from approaching the tree at sunrise to shooting long exposures and infrared film during the day. He caps off the shoot with some sunset shots and reviews the final selects to see what techniques worked best.
