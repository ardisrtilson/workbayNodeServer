Photoshop 2021 is a big, ambitious update, packed with automated features, AI-enabled retouching filters, and time-saving innovations. In this course, expert Deke McClelland brings you up to speed with every single new feature in the software.

Experiment with such practical and entertaining new filters as Skin Smoothing and Smart Portrait. Explore enhancements to Live Shapes, including on-canvas controls and a Line tool that draws open path outlines, complete with dynamic arrowheads. Learn how to review changes to collaborative cloud documents with the help of the powerful Version History panel. And thatâ€™s just the beginning.
