[Course_Description]
Learn the advanced features and workflows in Cubase Pro 10 for recording, performing, mixing, and producing music of all kinds. In this course, instructor Mark Struthers reviews next-level techniques such as leveraging advanced MIDI editing and recording options, creating VSTi tracks, applying insert and send effects, and metering and monitoring your tracks. Each lesson is based around a single course project: the rebuild of an original audio-book mix Mark made in Cubase 5.1, way back in 2001. The rebuild corrects the sibilance of the narration with de-essing, enhances the clarity of the instruments, incorporates new audio effects, and includes more realistic instrument samples. The final project is a test of your new skills and a testament to the enhanced power of Cubase 10. This course was created by Mark Struthers. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
