Many designers have experienced the frustration of having devised a singular, elegant solution, only to have it rejected by a client. While solid design skills are key to successfully selling your work, understanding how to collaborate with clients can be just as critical. In this course, learn how to win design projects, convince your clients to go with the best solutions, and cultivate lasting working relationships. Instructor Sean Adams shows how to begin a working relationship with a potential client, explaining how to sell yourself, present previous projects, and set appropriate expectations. He also provides tips for communicating during the design phase, crafting and delivering an impactful presentation, and dealing with a variety of common conflicts. In addition, he discusses how to maintain lasting relationships with clients, create more work, and determine when it's time to part ways with a client.
