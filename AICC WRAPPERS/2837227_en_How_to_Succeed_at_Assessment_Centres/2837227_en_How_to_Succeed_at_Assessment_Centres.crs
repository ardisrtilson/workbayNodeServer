[Course_Description]
Assessment centres are becoming more popular with organisations within the UK. Their ability to provide insights into a candidate’s performance potential mean they are a powerful tool for employers. Aimee Bateman—the founder of Careercake—has over 15 years of experience as a recruiter and an extensive track record designing assessment centres for small businesses and global brands. In this course, Aimee explains what to expect on the day, how to perform at your best, and how to think like the assessor. Learn what to expect from test scenarios such as work simulations, role play, and group exercises and find out how to ace your interview and follow up afterwards. Aimee also presents perspectives from Careercake viewers who have been through this final hurdle of the application process. This course was created by Careercake, the careers content platform. We are pleased to host this training in our library.
