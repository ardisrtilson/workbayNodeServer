Demonstrate your mastery of Outlook 2016 by becoming a Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS). In this course, certified MOS Master instructor Megan Hoffman helps you get ready for exam 77-731 by diving into the four main areas of the Outlook 2016 MOS exam: managing the Outlook environment for productivity, managing messages, managing schedules, and managing contacts and groups. Megan begins with an overview of the certification program, and then walks through all of the certification objectives. As you review each topic, you can use downloadable sample documents to practice as you go. Megan wraps up the course with a full-length practice test that emulates the Outlook 2016 MOS exam, together with solutions to each of the exam challenges.
