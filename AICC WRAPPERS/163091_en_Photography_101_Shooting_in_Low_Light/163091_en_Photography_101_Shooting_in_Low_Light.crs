[Course_Description]
Exploring the world of nighttime and low-light shooting is a great way to expand your photographic horizons. In this installment of Photography 101, photographer Joseph Linaschke provides an introduction to the creative options and technical considerations behind night and low-light shooting. Joseph explores indoor, candlelit scenes; bright cities, where he shows how to capture spectacular traffic trails; and the great outdoors, under the natural light of the moon and stars. The course also contains tips on using your iPhone or other smartphone for low-light photography—or even as a light source—and enhancing noisy, high-ISO images in post-production.
