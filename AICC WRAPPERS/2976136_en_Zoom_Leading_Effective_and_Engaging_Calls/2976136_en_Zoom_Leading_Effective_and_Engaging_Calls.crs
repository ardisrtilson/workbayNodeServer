[Course_Description]
Lead Zoom meetings and webinars with confidence. In this course, instructor Zack Arnold shows how to ensure that your next Zoom call is effective, productive, and engaging. Zack begins with a wealth of security tips for before, during, and after a call. Next, he shares strategies for maximizing audience engagement and interaction (as well as minimizing distractions and interruptions), whether your call is with 5 or 500 people. This includes adjusting view options so you never miss a participantâ€™s reactions, organizing windows to maximize eye contact, and using polls and reactions to interact with larger groups. Zack also covers the technical aspects of running Zoom calls, such as sharing video and audio content and trading off screen sharing between the facilitator and other presenters and cohosts. Plus, discover how to make the most of breakout rooms and advanced features like his favorite hot keys, as well as livestreaming your Zoom calls to the web.
