[Course_Description]
Regardless of how outstanding your strategy is, your organization won't derive any value from it until it has actually been implemented. But the process of implementing strategic plans—and cultivating a work culture that encourages teams to take action—requires thoughtful planning. You must link strategy, execution, and culture; create processes to support execution; execute the strategy; and be prepared to overcome obstacles. In this course, Mike Figliuolo demonstrates how to build a culture of strategy execution. He reviews the drivers of strategy execution and the fundamental concepts that companies need to pay attention to in order to realize their plans.
