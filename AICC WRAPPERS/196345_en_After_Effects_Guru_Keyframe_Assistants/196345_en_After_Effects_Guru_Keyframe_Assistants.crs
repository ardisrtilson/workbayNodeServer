[Course_Description]
Explore the tools in After Effects that help with the animation between the animation: keyframe assistants. These features help speed up repetitive tasks and add style to animations. This course starts with the basics: using the Keyframe Assistant tool itself to control the appearance, sequence, and timing of multiple layers within a single pre-composition. Then you'll move into very refined, keyframe-specific adjustments using a few different tools: Convert Audio to Keyframes, the Wiggler, ease adjustments, and expressions. In the final chapter, author Ian Robinson explores some very helpful third-party assistants like LayerMonkey, MotionMonkey, PlaneSpace, and Ecospace to speed up your day-to-day workflow.
