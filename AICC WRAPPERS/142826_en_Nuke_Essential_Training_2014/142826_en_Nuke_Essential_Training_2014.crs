[Course_Description]
Visual effects dominate at the box office, and Nuke is the compositing software that is used at high-end studios to create those mind-blowing effects. In this comprehensive course, digital compositing pioneer and Nuke authority Steve Wright introduces this complex and powerful tool to visual effects artists new to Nuke. Starting with an introduction to the unique node-based interface and progressing through techniques like color correction, keying, rotoscoping, and tracking, this course covers Nuke from top to bottom. This course was created by Steve Wright. We're honored to host this training in our library.
