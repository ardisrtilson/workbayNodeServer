Do you dread your annual performance review? In this course, instructors Ora Shtull and William Arruda teach you how to stop being a passive participant in your annual review and start being a powerful player in it. They walk you through a three-step process: own it, drive it, and ace it. You’ll learn what you need to do before, during, and even after the review to stand out and position yourself for promotion and a salary increase. You’ll discover how to deepen your relationship with your boss and be recognized by them for your achievements and goals. With this short course, you’ll be ready to ace your next review!
