[Course_Description]
Microsoft Lists isn't your ordinary list-making app. This powerful information tracking app in Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365) stores multiple pieces of information about each item on a list, and allows you to view that information in specific, useful ways. Lists can help your team stay on task and organized with product inventories, bug trackers, detailed event schedules, and much more. This short course was designed to help you get up to speed with Lists. Instructor Nick Brazzi shows how to create a list from scratch or from a predesigned template. He then explains how to edit your newly created list, change the layout and create new custom views (including a calendar view), and share lists across your organization. And since Microsoft Lists integrates with Microsoft Teams, Nick also shows how to build and collaborate on your lists in Teams.
