[Course_Description]
Most aspiring leaders know they need executive presence: the ability to project authority, confidence, and authenticity. Yet presence can be hard to establish, especially for women. This course can help aspiring female executives build and sustain their executive presence. Focusing on three executive presence filters—self-confidence (how you act), self-expression (how you talk), and self-presentation (how you look)—participants practice owning their power and making their credibility known. You can get tips to strengthen your ability to command a room, sell your ideas, and connect with others. Women’s leadership expert Selena Rezvani grounds each lesson in real-world examples, giving female leaders a playbook to make their presence felt in any situation.
