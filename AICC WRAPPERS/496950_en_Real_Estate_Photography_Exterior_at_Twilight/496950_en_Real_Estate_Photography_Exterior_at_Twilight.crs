Twilight is the magic hourâ€”not just for portraits, but for real estate photography, too. But there is a very narrow window for getting the perfect shot. Architectural photographer Scott Hargis shows how shoot an exterior view at twilight, mixing natural and interior lighting to make a house look its best. Learn how to set up your shots, wait for the right moment, use interior lights for warmth and interest, and enhance the final images in Photoshop.
