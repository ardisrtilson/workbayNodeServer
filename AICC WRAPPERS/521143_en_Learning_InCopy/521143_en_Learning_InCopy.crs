[Course_Description]
Designers often receive textual content from users created in programs such as Microsoft Word and then place that content into an InDesign layout that only the designer can access. InCopy provides a two-way street where editors and writers can edit content in InCopy while a designer simultaneously works on the design portion of the project in InDesign, and the text formatting is retained in both programs. In this course, learn how to create and import content using InCopy, style text correctly so that it transfers to the InDesign layout, and make content available to writers and editors from within InDesign. Author Chad Chelius also ensures that you get a handle on checking out stories, working with tables, using Track Changes, modifying graphics, as well as creating templates.
