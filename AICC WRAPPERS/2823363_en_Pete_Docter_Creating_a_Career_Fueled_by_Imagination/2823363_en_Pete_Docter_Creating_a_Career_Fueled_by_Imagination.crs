[Course_Description]
Pete Docter’s imagination is capable of some pretty incredible things. As a director at Pixar Animation Studios, Pete brought us Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Up. These films make audiences wonder and dream. In this audio-only course, Justin Ahrens travels to California to sit down with Pete and learn about how these stories originate in his imagination and end up on the big screen. Learn about how the creative process starts early in life, how ideas are developed at Pixar, and why teamwork and great influences—from art to travel—are so important to creativity. This course was created by Justin Ahrens. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
