[Course_Description]
Join photographer Lauren Enright for a look at the techniques behind creating great natural-light portraits of kids in the environment that's most comfortable for them: the outdoors. Lauren takes a family of five to a Chicago park to take pictures of the kids (a baby, a toddler, and a 6-year-old girl) posed in front of different backdrops. Along the way, she'll discuss lighting, camera settings, safety, and the gear you need to take great pictures of kids.
