[Course_Description]
With so many different devices on the market, web designers are faced with the challenge of creating multiple versions of their graphics for phones and tablets. Let Chris Converse show you how to leverage Smart Objects, clipping masks, and slices in Adobe Photoshop and make graphics that will look razor sharp on any screen. Learn how to produce web graphics for small screens, standard-sized images, and high-resolution or retina-enabled graphics from the very same file. This course was created and produced by Chris Converse. We are honored to host this content in our library.
