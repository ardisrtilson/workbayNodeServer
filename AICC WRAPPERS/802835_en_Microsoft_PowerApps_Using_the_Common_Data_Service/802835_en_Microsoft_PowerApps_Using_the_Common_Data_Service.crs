[Course_Description]
With the Common Data Service for Apps (CDS for Apps), you can securely store your organization’s data and use it to create mobile-first business apps that also run in browsers. This cutting-edge tech—based on a partnership between Microsoft, SAP, and Adobe—allows you to use prebuilt and custom entities to store data in a way that makes the most sense for your business. In this course, Gini shows how to use and customize the Common Data Service for Apps for use with the Power Platform to create data-rich applications for Dynamics, SharePoint, and Office 365. She explains how to set up CDS, build new apps, define entities and relationships, create data flows between applications with business rules, and create environments and databases using CDS for Apps.
