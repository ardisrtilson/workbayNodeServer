Make the most of PowerPoint for education. This course shows how to use PowerPoint 365 as an educational tool to engage learners, not just a delivery method for learning materials. Instructor Alan Ackmann explains how to create interactive learning experiences that help increase learning retention and make for more engaging lessons, using images, animation, links, shapes, and multimedia. He also explores new ways of creating presentations, with PowerPoint Designer, QuickStarter, icon sets, and inking. Plus, learn how to boost the interactivity of your PowerPoint designs with tools like Morph and Zoom and leverage the wide variety of add-ins designed specifically for educators.
