[Course_Description]
Customer success is a new field that goes beyond the more traditional sales, marketing, and customer support. Teams are being created to manage the customer life cycle and drive adoption, renewals, upselling, and advocacy. Customer success is one of the hottest B2B trends since the advent of the subscription business model. This course goes over the key components of customer success, or CS, including how CS fits into SaaS, membership, and service-oriented models—businesses that depend on long-term relationships to maximize customer lifetime value. Learn how it's different from customer support, what makes a successful CS sales professional and CS leader, and how to align CS with the larger organization.
