In the world of photography, even the simplest accessories can cost a few days' salary. The answer? Don't buy it. Build it! That's the idea behind The Do-It-Yourself Photographer. Photographer and educator Joseph Linaschke shows how you can fashion ordinary items—from plastic cups to clamps to parchment paper—into accessories that will improve lighting, stabilize your camera, and much more. So roll up your sleeves and break out the gaffer's tape. Learn how to become a DIY photographer.
