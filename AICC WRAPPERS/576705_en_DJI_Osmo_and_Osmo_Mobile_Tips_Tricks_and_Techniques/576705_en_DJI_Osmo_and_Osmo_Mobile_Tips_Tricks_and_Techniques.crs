[Course_Description]
DJI Osmo and Osmo Mobile are all about steadiness. Thanks to their sophisticated gimbal—which is similar to that of the DJI Phantom quadcopters—these devices enable you to shoot buttery-smooth video as well as long-exposure photos without a tripod. In this course, Rich Harrington details the features of the DJI Osmo and Osmo Mobile, shows how to set them up for best results, and then dives into an array of tips and techniques aimed at helping you shoot panoramas, long-exposure photos, and smooth video. Plus, learn about helpful accessories and other items you may want to add to your camera kit.
