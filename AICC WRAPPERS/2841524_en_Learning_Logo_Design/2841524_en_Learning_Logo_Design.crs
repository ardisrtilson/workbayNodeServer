Avoid pitfalls, improve your design process, respond to demanding clients, and solve the creative problems that are involved in creating a logo. In this course, Von Glitschka shows you how to take care of the essentials, like establishing the scope of work and pricing, and critical design decisions involved in building a brand identity package. Learn to define your client's expectations before the project begins with customer briefs and mood boards. Find out what the attributes of a great logo are, where to look for inspiration, and how to use sketches to propel you through the design process. Then Von turns to the business side and explains how to present your designs to clients and follow up on both positive and negative feedback. Finally, learn how to launch the logo and develop a narrative that will keep the visual style of the brand intact in the future.
