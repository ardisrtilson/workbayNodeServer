[Course_Description]
You've lined up a remote interview for an exciting creative role. Now what? In this course, Chris Nodder helps you ace the interview and land the job, sharing tips for preparing for and performing well in interviews conducted over the phone or in video calls. Chris begins by highlighting the differences between remote and in-person interviews, explaining why the virtual hiring process can put a cap on the amount of information you can share, the body language you can detect, and the expressions you can see. He then covers how to look and sound your best in video meetings and phone calls, as well as how different interview formats and question types play out in virtual interviews. Plus, he discusses how to appropriately follow up with your interviewer after the interview is a wrap.
