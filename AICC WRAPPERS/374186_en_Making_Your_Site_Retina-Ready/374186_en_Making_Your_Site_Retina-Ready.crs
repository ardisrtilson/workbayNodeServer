With stunning new screens like the Apple Retina display coming onto the market, many designers want to learn how to make their sites retina-ready. This course provides several options for optimizing graphics and other content so that it looks great on retina (or HiDPI) and non-retina displays alike. Author Brian Wood covers incorporating icon fonts and favicons, optimizing SVG and inline images, and displaying responsive images using CSS, JavaScript, and the PictureFill polyfill solution.
