Facial features are the some of the most difficult to model realisticallyâ€”especially the skinfolds, wrinkles, and complexion changes that occur with age. But with the awesome sculpting and painting tools in CINEMA 4D, you can create realistic character busts. Join Chris Broeska as he shows how to use CINEMA 4D's exciting sculpting tools to sculpt the head of an old man and paint a great-looking texture map with BodyPaint.
