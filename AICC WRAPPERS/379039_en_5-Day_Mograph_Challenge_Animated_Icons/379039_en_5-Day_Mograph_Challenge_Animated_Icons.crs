Want to learn how to put client's branding in motion? Practice it one day at a time with this 5-day mograph challenge. Author EJ Hassenfratz asks artists to create a different animated icon each day, taking existing logos and putting them into motion. These challenges help you solve creative problems and round out your portfolio, while building on skills you've learned in previous 5-day mograph challenges. Get feedback by sharing your work on Facebook and Twitter using the hashtag #5dayMograph, and by posting it to our Tumblr page at 5daymograph.tumblr.com.
