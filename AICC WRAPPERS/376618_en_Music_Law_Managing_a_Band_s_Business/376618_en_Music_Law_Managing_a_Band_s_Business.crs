[Course_Description]
Any band can encounter problems such as financial mismanagement and contract disputes. Learn to avoid the major music business pitfalls that can break bands apart in this course with Richard Stim, attorney and music law specialist. It starts with what it means to be the manager of a band, and what types of business structures are available for bands. Once you've decided on a business structure, you can create a band partnership agreement that covers voting rights, postbreakup scenarios, new members, and terms for resolving disputes. Richard also exposes potential sources of disputes, like ownership of the band name, songs, equipment, and recordings. He includes advice on negotiating solid band contracts and managing financial basics: taxes, income, cash flow, and bookkeeping. Finally, he'll address how to protect your work, including your copyrights, band name, and songs, and explains how to find a lawyerâ€”and save money on attorney fees.
