[Course_Description]
Design patterns in C# can save you a lot of time, as you donâ€™t have to recreate code that has already been proven. In this course, instructor Richard Goforth explains what design patterns are and how you can recognize and implement five C# patterns: Observer, Builder, Command, Proxy, and Chain of Responsibility. For each pattern, Richard gives a definition, at least one example of how to implement or use it, any other explanations you may need, and a practice challenge. He concludes with some suggestions on where to continue your education in C# application design with patterns.
