Workplace change is a constant. To successfully achieve business goals in this landscape, managers need to help their employees learn how to adapt to changing conditions. In this course, eParachute founder Gary Bolles outlines why workers—and managers—need to be adaptive, and what skills managers can help employees develop in order to be resilient.
