[Course_Description]
By adopting the principles of ethical persuasion when working with customers, colleagues, and friends, you can use the power of influence to benefit all parties. In this course, adapted from the podcast How to Be Awesome at Your Job, dive into the language of influence and learn about the ethical way to get people to say “yes. Brian Ahearn outlines the three rules to follow for ethical persuasion. He explains why emphasizing what people will miss out on if they don’t use your product or service can attract attention and distinguish your offerings as rare and unique. Plus, learn how to phrase requests in a way that ensures that people will follow through, use questions to better communicate your needs and respond to the needs of others, and more.
