[Course_Description]
MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) design is one of the major components of the BIM chainâ€”and Revit is the design tool of choice for many MEP engineers. This course focuses on the MEP features of Revit 2018, the latest version of the software. It's designed for the novice user who prefers to work in metric units (meters, centimeters, etc.). You can dive into a specific trade, or take the entire course to learn about all aspects of the vast Revit MEP ecosystem. Upon completion, you'll know how to create basic floor plans, design electric circuits and lighting systems, model air intake and exhaust systems, create plumbing plans, and design fire alarm and sprinkler systems, and document your designs for construction and fabrication.
