Autodesk Civil 3D 2021 is a feature-packed design and documentation solution for civil engineering, design, and surveying. By mastering the best-in-class tools within Civil 3D, you can boost your efficiency and effectiveness as a civil engineer, surveyor, or designer. In this course, join instructor Eric Chappell as he helps you get up and running with this powerful software, showing you how to use most of the tools in Civil 3D as you work through a project: a new residential development.
