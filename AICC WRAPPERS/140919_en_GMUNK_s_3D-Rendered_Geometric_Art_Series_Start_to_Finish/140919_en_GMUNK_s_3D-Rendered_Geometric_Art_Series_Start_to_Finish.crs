[Course_Description]
In this episode of Start to Finish, graphic designer Bradley G Munkowitz, known to his ardent fan base as GMUNK, lets us into his studio and reveals his process for creating op-art-inspired geometric prints. Learn how he uses a web app developed with code artist Marcin Ignac to divide simple primitives into complex multifaceted shapes, and then sends the results to Maya for shading, lighting, and rendering. It's a completely unorthodox use of this 3D toolsetâ€”but it's typical of GMUNK's work.
