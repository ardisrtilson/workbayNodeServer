[Course_Description]
You may be familiar with the fundamental concepts of object-oriented design—inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction—but there is a set of higher-level design principles that can be used to take your design to the next level. Design principles guide your design decisions to produce software that is more reliable, flexible, and maintainable. Join instructor Eric Freeman as he goes beyond the standard concepts of object-oriented programming to introduce you to the most notable design principles, including encapsulate what varies, favor composition over inheritance, loose coupling, and the SOLID principles. Each lesson includes examples that show how these principles can be used to avoid costly design mistakes and create more maintainable, high-quality software.
