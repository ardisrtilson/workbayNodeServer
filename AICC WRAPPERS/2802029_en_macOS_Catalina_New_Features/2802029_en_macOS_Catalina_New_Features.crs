Explore new features of macOS Catalina, including ways to use your voice to control your Mac and dictate text, an app that shows how much time you spend on various activities, and a feature that lets you wirelessly use an iPad as a secondary display. Instructor Nick Brazzi delves into the Music app, which is a replacement for the discontinued iTunes app. Nick also covers many convenient updates inside apps including folder sharing in Notes, automatic sorting in Reminders, and the Picture in Picture video option in QuickTime, Safari, and other apps.
