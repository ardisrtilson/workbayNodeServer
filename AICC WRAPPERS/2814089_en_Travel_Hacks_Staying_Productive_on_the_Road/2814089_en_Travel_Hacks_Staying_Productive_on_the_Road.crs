[Course_Description]
Businesspeople often assume they can remain productive on the road simply by making sure they have their laptop, phone, or tablet with them, but there’s so much more to it. Being productive while on the go requires both juggling your daily work schedule and staying on top of a travel itinerary—as you navigate airports, hotels, and busy surroundings—simultaneously. Travel expert Garrick Chow shares inside tricks and tips including bringing the right tech gear, the best seats to choose for working while flying, how to take advantage of hidden hotel business amenities, and making sure your files are secure so they can’t be lost or stolen while you’re on the road.
