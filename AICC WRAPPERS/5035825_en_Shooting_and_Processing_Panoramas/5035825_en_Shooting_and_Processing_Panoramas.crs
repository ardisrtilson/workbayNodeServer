[Course_Description]
When one photo doesn't do justice to a scene, take severalâ€”and then stitch them together into a panorama. In this course, Rich Harrington details every step in the process, from shooting to stitching. Rich begins with a look at the creative options provided by panoramic photographs. He then describes the technical details for getting great original shots: how to properly mount the camera on a tripod, how to overlap each shot, which lenses deliver best results, and more. After shooting a variety of panoramas, he shows how to process them using various software tools, from Lightroom to Adobe Camera Raw and Photoshop.
