[Course_Description]
A collaboration and communication service such as Microsoft Teams can be an invaluable tool for businesses. But investing in such enterprise IT systems can be costly, and the investment may only be worthwhile if the IT system runs effectively and efficiently, allowing end users to be productive. In this course, learn how to properly configure settings and policies for meetings, users, and groups within Microsoft Teams. Instructor Robert McMillen covers how to enable key features and apply them to users and groups, manage phone numbers, create and configure auto attendants so callers are better able to direct themselves to the person with whom they need to speak, and much more. This course can also help you prepare for the Managing Microsoft Teams exam (MS-700).
