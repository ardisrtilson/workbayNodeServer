[Course_Description]
Review the construction modeling and design documentation process from start to finish in Autodesk Revit. In this project-based course, Brian Myers shows how to use the tools in Revit to build plans for an American-style bungalow from scratch. To help lend real-world context to the concepts he covers, Brian steps through the creation of a project in Revit, providing you with practical experience with key Revit tools. Learn how to add walls, doors, and windows to your project, as well as how to place ceilings and create a roof. Plus, see how to create 2D and 3D views, model a site, and more. By the end of this course, you will have built a model of a multilevel residence and created multiple sheets in the design documentation set, as well as sections, details, and schedules.
