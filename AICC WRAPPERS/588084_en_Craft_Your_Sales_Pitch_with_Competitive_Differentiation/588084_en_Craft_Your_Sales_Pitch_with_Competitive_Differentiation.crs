[Course_Description]
Competitive differentiation is crucial to high-margin sales that close quickly. When customers view you, your organization, and your product as something truly special—and not just a commodity—you can avoid price concessions and win more business. Lack of competitive differentiation results in an endless sales process—and the decision nearly always comes down to price. In this course, learn how to add value and differentiate yourself from the first call to the proposal. Authors and leadership experts Lisa Earle McLeod and Elizabeth McLeod cover everything from crafting your opening statement, to asking the right questions, to asking your clients for their business.
