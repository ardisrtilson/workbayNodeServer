[Course_Description]
Managing the relationship between an organisation and its people is essential to providing fair and practical outcomes for both sides. But in the era of digital and automated work, employee relations is in need of a refresh. This course provides an introduction to employee relations for the 21st century—the techniques and tools for creating stronger, more effective representation for workers in all industries. Instructor Perry Timms describes the rights and protections of workers and the tools that employees have at their disposal for representation and negotiation, from collective bargaining to arbitration. He also explores the importance of a strong psychological contract between employees and organisations, buoyed by diversity, inclusion, well-being, and engagement. Finally, explore essential skills for managing employee relations, including working with union reps, handling conflict, and representing the organisation professionally in disciplinary situations. Note: This course is the first in a LinkedIn Learning series aligned with the “People Practice” core knowledge area of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD).
