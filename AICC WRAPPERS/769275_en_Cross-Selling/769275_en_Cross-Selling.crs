[Course_Description]
Cross-selling is the practice of selling an additional product or service to an existing customer. It can generate a significant opportunity, as the relationship already exists, but ensuring the additional product or service sold to your clients enhances their value is critical. This course helps you understand cross-selling and its benefits and develop and execute a cross-selling strategy that works for your business. Sales and leadership coach Jeff Bloomfield also explains how to align sales and marketing to achieve improved sales, consistent messaging, and data-driven insights.
