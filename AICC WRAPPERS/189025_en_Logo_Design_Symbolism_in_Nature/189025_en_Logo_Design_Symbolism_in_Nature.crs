No other topic has driven corporate identity more quickly than sustainability. When it comes to logo design, whether businesses are tied directly to the environment or not, references to nature abound. In fact, the most-searched terms, year in and year out, on Bill Gardner's popular LogoLounge site are terms like tree, water, earth, and nature. In this course, Bill tackles the hidden symbolism behind how we depict our planet, from what's in the sky to what grows in the ground, and teaches you how to use these symbols to give your logo designs more impact. These valuable insights will have you looking at nature in ways you never considered before, and help you better explain the natural elements in your logo designs to your clients.
