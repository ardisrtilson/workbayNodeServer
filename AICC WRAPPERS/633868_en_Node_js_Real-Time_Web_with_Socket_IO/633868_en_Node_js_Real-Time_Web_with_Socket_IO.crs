[Course_Description]
Are you interested in building your own real-time web application, but unsure of how to get started? If so, this course can help by providing you with an overview of Socket.IO—a web library that enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication—and explaining how to use it to build a chat app with multiple rooms. Emmanuel Henri demonstrates how to create a server with Express and Socket.IO, code your front-end HTML, and create a chat with the emit function. He also covers how to add a namespace, code a new room within the namespace, and set up multiple rooms for your users.
