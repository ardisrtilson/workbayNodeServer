[Course_Description]
In this course, author and senior Kelley School of Business lecturer Judy Steiner-Williams shows you tips and techniques for responding to a request for proposal (RFP) and for crafting a well-conceived proposal from scratch. Using an actual RFP and real-life proposals, Judy emphasizes what elements to include in your own response. She also helps you understand the four proposal types, and how to gather research, anticipate potential questions and objections, and follow up successfully. With Judy's help, you'll be able to navigate the competitive and sometimes tedious world of proposals and write stronger submissions with a higher rate of acceptance.
