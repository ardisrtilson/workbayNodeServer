[Course_Description]
Lightroom is the ideal platform for sharing your images with clients, colleagues, or followers on social media. You can share photos with the world—and get detailed feedback—without ever leaving the application. However, each app in the Lightroom ecosystem has its own unique sharing workflow. This course shows how to customize your sharing settings and share photos and albums from all versions of Lightroom, including desktop, mobile, Classic, and Lightroom on the web. Instructor Theresa Jackson also shows you how to invite collaborators and contribute to shared albums, use Lightroom photos in Adobe mobile apps like Photoshop Fix and Adobe Capture, and tell photographic stories with Lightroom and Adobe Spark.
