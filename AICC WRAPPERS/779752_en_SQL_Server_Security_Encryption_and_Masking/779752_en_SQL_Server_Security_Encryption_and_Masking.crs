[Course_Description]
Learn how to build more secure applications using the advanced security features in SQL Server 2017. Instructor Joey D'Antoni takes a deep dive into SQL Server row-level security, which allows you to restrict access to specific table data, and shows how to encrypt data using the built-in features in SQL Server, such as Always Encrypted, which protects sensitive client data without revealing encryption keys. Plus, discover how to perform data masking to prevent low-privileged users from seeing confidential information.
