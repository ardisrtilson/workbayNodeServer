[Course_Description]
The photographic gear that will most directly affect the way your portraits look? It's not the camera. It's the lens. Photographer, author, and educator Chris Orwig compares and contrasts wide-angle, normal, and telephoto lenses, with the goal of helping you choose the right lens for both the subject of your portrait and the message you want to convey. Along the way, he shoots photos with different lenses, at different angles and different depths of field, and shares the results so you can actually see how these choices impact the final photographs. Plus, Chris shares his recommendations on finding the lens that's right for you, with a review of some common prime and zoom lenses.
