[Course_Description]
Ableton Link is a simple but vital utility that helps musicians collaborate. With Link, they can sync Ableton Live tracks with the sounds captured on other computers and any Link-enabled iOS music-making apps. It's one of the easiest ways to make sure everyone in your sessions is in timeâ€”no cables required. In this short course, author Yeuda Ben-Atar quickly demonstrates his techniques for using Ableton Link to set up and synchronize multiple computers and iOS devices, and demos the Link workflow in a short jam session featuring Ableton Live and the Ableton Push controller. Note: Ableton Live is not required to use Link. It works with dozens of supported apps. See the complete list here.
