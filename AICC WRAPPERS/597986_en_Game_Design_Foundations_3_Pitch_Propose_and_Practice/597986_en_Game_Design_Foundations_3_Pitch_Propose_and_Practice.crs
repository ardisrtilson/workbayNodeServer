[Course_Description]
Simply having a great idea for a game isn't enough. Game designers must also be able to pitch their ideas, and clearly explain how their game works and why others should be excited about their design. In this course—the third installment in the Game Design Foundations series—learn how to pitch your ideas, document your design, and prepare yourself to enter the game industry. Award-winning game designer Brenda Romero provides a detailed look at game design documents, and steps through how to successfully pitch your ideas. She also shares tips for improving your game design skills, and dives into the differences between making games in the game industry and building games as an indie.
