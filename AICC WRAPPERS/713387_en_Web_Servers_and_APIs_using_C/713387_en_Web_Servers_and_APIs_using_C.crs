[Course_Description]
C++ has re-emerged as a go-to language for developing high-performance websites and web applications. C++ compiles to machine code, making it faster to start up and execute. For users, this means less time waiting for a site to render. This course teaches developers how to build a website powered by a MongoDB database and deploy it with a Heroku cloud server, all with C++. Instructor Troy Miles—a senior software developer—shows how to build and deliver HTML webpages; upload, download, and parse JSON data; make RESTful API calls; and even do real-time communication using WebSockets. Along the way, he shows how to resolve one of the main challenges of C++ web development—a complex toolchain that must be synced in development and production—using Docker containers.
