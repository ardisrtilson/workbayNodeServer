[Course_Description]
So you've completed the Inventor Essential Training. Now you're looking for a challenging project to lock in your new skills. This course is for you: a retro product design project for a vintage beverage caddy. Jana Schmidt walks through a typical product design workflow in Inventor—sketching, modeling parts, building assemblies, and producing final drawings—all in the context of an eye-catching design. Jana reviews techniques such as setting up your project file; creating and modifying geometry; creating extrusions, sweeps, and lofts; and working with Inventor's freeform tools. She also shows how to combine your parts in an assembly, create presentation-quality animations and still renders of the design, and document the product design with working 2D drawings.
