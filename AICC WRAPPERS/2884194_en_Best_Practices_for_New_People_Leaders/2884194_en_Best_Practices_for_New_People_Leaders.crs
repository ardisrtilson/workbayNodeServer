If you’re new to management, you probably have one huge fear: that you’ll fail. While you probably became a manager because you excelled at your previous position, managing people brings a whole world of new challenges that require new skills. People can be unpredictable, and if you’re not properly equipped, the threat of failure is very real. In this course, Kirsten Blakemore teaches how to be a heart-forward manager who leads with compassion, curiosity, and integrity. She shares specific tips on how to lead teams remotely and how to create a cohesive and open team culture. Kirsten covers how to handle tricky tasks like giving difficult feedback and managing tough conversations. Finally, she gives advice on how to manage time as a leader, and how to manage a team to ensure their success. Join Kirsten as she shares her roadmap to make your transition into people leadership easier, leaving you prepared to enjoy your promotion and thrive on your new career path.
