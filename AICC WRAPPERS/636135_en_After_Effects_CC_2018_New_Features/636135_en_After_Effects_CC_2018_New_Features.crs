[Course_Description]
Adobe After Effects CC 2018 offers new features that can enhance your VFX and motion graphics workflow. In this course, explore the major new additions to After Effects—including the latest version, 15.1, introduced in April 2018—and discover how to leverage them in your post-production process. Mark Christiansen provides a hands-on look at this update, showing how to edit keyboard shortcuts visually, create nulls from paths, automate motion with data-driven animation, use master properties to animate nested compositions, build smoother deformations with the Advanced Puppet tool, and more. In addition, he explains how to work with immersive video and customize your VR pipeline. To keep you up-to-date on the latest additions to After Effects CC 2018, Mark will update the course when new features are released.
