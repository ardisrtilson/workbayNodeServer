[Course_Description]
Podcasting is a great way to express yourself and connect with fans, but problems can arise when you're discussing provocative people and controversial issues (or using someone else's copyrighted content). In this course, author Rich Stim covers the legal and business issues associated with podcasting. He covers what you can and can't use in your podcastsâ€”to stay on the right side of the law. Rich also explains how to avoid disputes over your podcast, and addresses concerns about running a podcast business: generating an income, branching out when you need to hire help, paying taxes, and protecting your content with trademarks and copyrights.
