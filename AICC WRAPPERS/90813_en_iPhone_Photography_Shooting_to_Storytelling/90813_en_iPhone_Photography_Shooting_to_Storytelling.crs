[Course_Description]
In this course, Richard Koci Hernandez celebrates the art of iPhoneographyâ€”how to shoot, enhance, and share photos with an Apple iPhone. The course covers an actual iPhone photo shoot and includes details on how to select and edit photos using a variety of iOS apps and how to interact with the vibrant iPhone photo community by sharing photos using the popular Instagram app. In a bonus chapter, Koci and a lineup of iPhone photography enthusiasts and journalists meet at the 1197 conference in San Francisco to discuss shooting techniques, photo-enhancement tips, and inspiration in the art of photographic storytelling.
