[Course_Description]
Designing and producing animated ads that look great and work as expected in modern browsers can be a headacheâ€”unless you're using the new release of Adobe Animate CC. Animate CC allows you to export HTML5 and JavaScript files that are responsive and look great on any platform. This project takes you from a blank HTML Canvas project all the way to a finished banner ad, using Animate CC. Chris Converse shows how to assemble a composition using existing artwork and text, animate the different elements, add web fonts and a call to action, and make the ad clickable and controllable by the user. The course wraps up with a look at the different publishing options available in Animate CC.
