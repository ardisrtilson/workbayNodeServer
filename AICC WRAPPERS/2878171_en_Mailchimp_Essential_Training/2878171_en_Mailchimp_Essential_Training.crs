Mailchimp may have started as a newsletter service, but since its launch it has constantly added new features and has grown into a robust marketing solution for businesses of all sizes. In this course, Virginia O'Connor takes an in-depth look at all the features Mailchimp has to offer in addition to its already popular and powerful email marketing tools, from creating landing pages for your site, connecting your online store, building social media posts and online ads, and creating postcards to send to your audience. She also shows how to use Mailchimp to better know your customers through surveys and engagement, and how to make your marketing efforts more efficient through personalization, automation, and reports.
