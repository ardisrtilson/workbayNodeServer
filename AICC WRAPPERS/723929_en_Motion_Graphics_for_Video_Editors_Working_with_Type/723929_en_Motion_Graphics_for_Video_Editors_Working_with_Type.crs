[Course_Description]
Text is used in video projects all the time, whether it's in lower thirds or credits. As a video editor, it's crucial to learn the fundamentals of working with type: compositing type, animating type, and creating 3D text and logos. In this course, Rich Harrington shows how to perform these tasks in Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, and Premiere Pro, three programs that are tightly integrated and make it easy to share and hand off assets. Watch and learn how to add a new dimension to your video projects, with type.
