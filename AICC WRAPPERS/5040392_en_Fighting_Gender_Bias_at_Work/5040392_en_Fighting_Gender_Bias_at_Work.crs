[Course_Description]
Gender bias is holding women back in the workplace. Whether deliberate or unconscious, bias makes it harder for women to get hired and promoted and negatively impacts their day-to-day work experiences. Created by LeanIn.Org, this short video series—one introductory video and six two-to-three-minute videos—is designed to provide an understanding of how gender bias impacts women’s and men’s experiences at work. These videos cover the five most common types of biases women face and address the concept of intersectionality. The videos can be watched individually or paired with a card-based activity that brings people together to have meaningful discussions about gender bias.
