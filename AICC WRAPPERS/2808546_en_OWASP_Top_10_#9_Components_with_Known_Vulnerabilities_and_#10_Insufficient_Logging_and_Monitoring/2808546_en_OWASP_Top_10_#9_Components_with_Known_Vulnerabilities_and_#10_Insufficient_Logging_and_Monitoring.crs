[Course_Description]
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) was formed to provide the public with the resources needed to understand and enhance software security. The OWASP Top 10 list describes the ten biggest vulnerabilities. In this course, Caroline Wong takes a deep dive into the ninth and tenth categories of security vulnerabilities in the OWASP Top 10: using components with known vulnerabilities and insufficient logging and monitoring. Caroline covers how these threats work, providing real-world examples that demonstrate how insufficient logging and monitoring and using components with known vulnerabilities can affect companies and consumers alike. She also shares techniques that can help you prevent attacks stemming from these issues.
