[Course_Description]
Those who experience imposter syndrome often believe they are inferior to others or have faked their way into positions despite impressive accomplishments. Up to 70% of both women and men, especially high-achievers, experience imposter syndrome at some point in their career. This false belief system leads some people to self-sabotage, turn down career and growth opportunities, and limit their own career trajectories. Join instructor Carolyn Goerner as she explains the different types of imposter syndrome and shares constructive ways you can begin to overcome this negative thought cycle.
