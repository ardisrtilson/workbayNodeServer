By encouraging smaller, more frequent merges, continuous integration can help make it easier for you and your team to merge feature branches into your main branch. Xcode Server—a service provided by OS X Server—can also play a part in this process. In this course, learn how continuous integration and Xcode Server can help you streamline your development workflow. Learn how to install and set up Xcode Server, create a bot for your project, download build artifacts, and more.
