[Course_Description]
How do you become a better motion graphics designer? Alberto Scirocco advises his students to paint, to sculpt, to danceâ€”to explore a different aspect of their creativity and bring those lessons back to their designs. This is also the methodology behind his firm, leftchannel, and its high-profile motion-based projects for clients like Nike. In this episode of The Creative Spark, Alberto describes his journey from an architectural student in Italy to the head of a multidisciplinary design studio in Columbus, Ohio. From this unlikely location, leftchannel has been producing award-winning projects that combine illustration, 3D modeling, 2D compositing, animation, and augmented reality work.
