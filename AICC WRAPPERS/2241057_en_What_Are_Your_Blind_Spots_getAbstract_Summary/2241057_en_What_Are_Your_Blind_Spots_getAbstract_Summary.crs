[Course_Description]
Statistics say that about 70% of employees suffer disengagement from their jobs. Unfortunately, many leaders have no idea how to engage their employees due to insidious blind spots in their thinking. Learn how to recognize the leadership blind spots that can derail you from truly engaging with your employees, in this audio-only summary of Jim Haudan and Rich Berens’s popular book. Cofounders of the Root Inc. consultancy, Jim and Rich warn that failing to recognize these blind spots can cause you to stifle your best employees instead of giving them the autonomy to do their finest and most engaged work. To transform your organization and unlock the potential of your employees, the authors say, just open your eyes. This audiobook summary was created by getAbstract, the world’s largest provider of business book summaries. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
