This course shows off the latest techniques and devices for recording live music with the Apple iPad. Author and musician Garrick Chow explores real-world recording scenarios, including the iPad's built-in input options (and why to avoid them), and shares alternative methods of getting your audio in and out of the iPad. The course covers instrument input devices like the Apogee Jam and Alesis iO Dock, compares microphones, and shows how to connect and play MIDI devices through the iPad.
