[Course_Description]
PNG-24 files provide great quality with the added benefit of 8-bit transparency; however, this particular file format can be rather large. And larger files sizes mean longer loading times for your users. The good news is you can create varying transparent PNG-8 files—files that are between 60% and 80% smaller than PNG-24 files—with a new crop of Windows, Mac, and web-based tools. Chris Converse shows you how in this short, insightful course on creating compressed PNGs that display beautifully on a variety of websites, especially those targeting mobile devices.
