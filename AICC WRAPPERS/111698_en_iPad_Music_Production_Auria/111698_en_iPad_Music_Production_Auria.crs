[Course_Description]
Auria is the first major digital audio workstation designed specifically for the Apple iPad, and in this course, author and professional musician Garrick Chow demonstrates how to use its recording, editing, and mixing tools to create great-sounding music. First, Garrick reviews the hardware you'll need to start capturing audio, from microphones to cables and input devices. He then demonstrates how to record anything from a single audio track to a complete multitrack capture of a live band performance, or import audio from other iPad apps with Audiobus. He also shows you how to edit your tracks by adding splits and trims, apply effects, and use automation to create a final mix. Plus, learn to take snapshots so you can save your mix in different states along the way. Last, Garrick reviews the options for exporting your project from Auria in several formats to share it with the world. This course will be updated regularly as new features are added to Auria, so check back often. Working with a different app?
