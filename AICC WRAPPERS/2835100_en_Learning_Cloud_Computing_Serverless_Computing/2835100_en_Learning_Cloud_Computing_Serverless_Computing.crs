[Course_Description]
Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure. This course is targeted at IT professionals who need to gain a foundational knowledge of serverless computing—what it is and why it's important—and what's offered by serverless computing technologies like AWS Lambda and Azure Functions. Instructor David Linthicum begins with the basics: what serverless computing is and the problems it can solve. He then explores effective use cases for serverless computing and runs through demos of both AWS Lambda and Azure Functions.
