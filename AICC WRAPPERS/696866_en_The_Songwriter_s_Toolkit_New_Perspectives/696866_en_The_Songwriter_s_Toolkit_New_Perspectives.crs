[Course_Description]
Great songs often come to us in bits and pieces. A perfect verse pops into our head like a gift, but we struggle to come up with a chorus or second verse that feels right. In this course, learn practical songwriting techniques that can help you look at your tune through a different lensâ€”and, in turn, take your song to unexpected new places. Professional musician Julian Velard shows how to play with melody, form, and chords to gain a fresh perspective when a tune has you stuck. Along the way, Julian demonstrates each technique by playing musical examples.
