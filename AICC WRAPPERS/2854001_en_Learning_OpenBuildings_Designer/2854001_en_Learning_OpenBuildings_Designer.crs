[Course_Description]
Discover OpenBuildings Designer, the BIM software for architects and professional building modelers. This introductory course focuses on 3D modeling in OpenBuildings Designer, teaching concepts through a fun example building: a transportation station. Though the building design is relatively simple, it has some unique design elements, including a custom platform roof canopy. Instructor Mary Chib teachers you how to set up your modeling environment and create models with basic structural, architectural, and interior elements: columns and footings, walls and windows, casework and furniture, and more. She also shows how to work with assemblies, create a custom profile, and view the drawings and schedules for your design.
