Is accurate color important in photography? Accuracy is important for portraiture and product shots, but beyond that, all's fair in photography. A blue color cast could be just right in a photo of a winter snow scene or a dusk city skyline. And a yellow color cast might help convey the heat of a desert landscape. In this course, photographer, author, and educator Ben Long explores the art and science of white balance and color temperature. Ben explores how to adjust your camera's white-balance settings, and what to do when auto white balance goes wrong. He then surveys some optional aids for white balance, and scenarios where inaccurate color may well be the right stylistic choice.
