Bring your sonic ideas to life with Reason 10, the professional-grade DAW from Propellerhead Software. In this course, Matt Piper demonstrates all of the major features of Reason 10, from setup to recording and mixing to mastering. First, he shows how to set up the preferences, use the Reason browser, and work with various windows and keyboard shortcuts. Next, he moves into recording music, showing how to record audio and virtual instrument tracks, create beats, sample audio, use REX loops, and record automation. He then demonstrates the tools used for editing—including quantization and pitch correction—and shows how to use the mixing functions. To wrap up, he demonstrates how to use the mastering tools in Reason, as well as how to quickly export individual audio tracks.
